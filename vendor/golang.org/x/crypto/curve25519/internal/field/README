This package is kept in sync with crypto/ed25519/internal/edwards25519/field in
the standard library.

If there are any changes in the standard library that need to be synced to this
package, run sync.sh. It will not overwrite any local changes made since the
previous sync, so it's ok to land changes in this package first, and then sync
to the standard library later.
