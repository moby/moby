Package propagation contains OpenTelemetry context propagators.

This package is currently in a Release Candidate phase. Backwards incompatible changes
may be introduced prior to v1.0.0, but we believe the current API is ready to stabilize.

OpenTelemetry propagators are used to extract and inject context data from and
into messages exchanged by applications. The propagator supported by this
package is the W3C Trace Context encoding
(https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/), and W3C Baggage
(https://w3c.github.io/baggage/).
