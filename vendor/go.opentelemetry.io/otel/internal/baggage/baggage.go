Package baggage provides base types and functionality to store and retrieve
baggage in Go context. This package exists because the OpenTracing bridge to
OpenTelemetry needs to synchronize state whenever baggage for a context is
modified and that context contains an OpenTracing span. If it were not for
this need this package would not need to exist and the
`go.opentelemetry.io/otel/baggage` package would be the singular place where
W3C baggage is handled.
