// Package resource provides detecting and representing resources.
//
// This package is currently in a Release Candidate phase. Backwards incompatible changes
// may be introduced prior to v1.0.0, but we believe the current API is ready to stabilize.
//
// The fundamental struct is a Resource which holds identifying information
// about the entities for which telemetry is exported.
//
// To automatically construct Resources from an environment a Detector
// interface is defined. Implementations of this interface can be passed to
// the Detect function to generate a Resource from the merged information.
//
// To load a user defined Resource from the environment variable
// OTEL_RESOURCE_ATTRIBUTES the FromEnv Detector can be used. It will interpret
// the value as a list of comma delimited key/value pairs
// (e.g. `<key1>=<value1>,<key2>=<value2>,...`).
package resource // import "go.opentelemetry.io/otel/sdk/resource"
