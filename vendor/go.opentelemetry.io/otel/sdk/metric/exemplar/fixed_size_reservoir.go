	// O(n(1+log(N/n)))". ACM Transactions on Mathematical Software. 20 (4):
	// 481â€“493 (https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/198429.198435).
	//
	// A high-level overview of "Algorithm L":
	//   0) Pre-calculate the random count greater than the storage size when
	//      an exemplar will be replaced.
	//   1) Accept all measurements offered until the configured storage size is
	//      reached.
	//   2) Loop:
	//      a) When the pre-calculate count is reached, replace a random
	//         existing exemplar with the offered measurement.
	//      b) Calculate the next random count greater than the existing one
	//         which will replace another exemplars
	//
	// The way a "replacement" count is computed is by looking at `n` number of
	// independent random numbers each corresponding to an offered measurement.
	// Of these numbers the smallest `k` (the same size as the storage
	// capacity) of them are kept as a subset. The maximum value in this
	// subset, called `w` is used to weight another random number generation
	// for the next count that will be considered.
	//
	// By weighting the next count computation like described, it is able to
	// perform a uniformly-weighted sampling algorithm based on the number of
	// samples the reservoir has seen so far. The sampling will "slow down" as
	// more and more samples are offered so as to reduce a bias towards those
	// offered just prior to the end of the collection.
	//
	// This algorithm is preferred because of its balance of simplicity and
	// performance. It will compute three random numbers (the bulk of
	// computation time) for each item that becomes part of the reservoir, but
	// it does not spend any time on items that do not. In particular it has an
	// asymptotic runtime of O(k(1 + log(n/k)) where n is the number of
	// measurements offered and k is the reservoir size.
	//
	// See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reservoir_sampling for an overview of
	// this and other reservoir sampling algorithms. See
	// https://github.com/MrAlias/reservoir-sampling for a performance
	// comparison of reservoir sampling algorithms.
