Package instrumentation provides an instrumentation library structure to be
passed to both the OpenTelemetry Tracer and Meter components.

This package is currently in a Release Candidate phase. Backwards incompatible changes
may be introduced prior to v1.0.0, but we believe the current API is ready to stabilize.

For more information see
[this](https://github.com/open-telemetry/oteps/blob/main/text/0083-component.md).
