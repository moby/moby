The encoding/binary package can only serialize types with known sizes.

differ on different architectures. Furthermore, it doesn't support
serializing maps, channels, strings, or functions.

Before Go 1.8, bool wasn't supported, either.

var docSA1004 = `Suspiciously small untyped constant in time.Sleep

The time.Sleep function takes a time.Duration as its only argument.
Durations are expressed in nanoseconds. Thus, calling time.Sleep(1)
will sleep for 1 nanosecond. This is a common source of bugs, as sleep
functions in other languages often accept seconds or milliseconds.

The time package provides constants such as time.Second to express
large durations. These can be combined with arithmetic to express
arbitrary durations, for example '5 * time.Second' for 5 seconds.

If you truly meant to sleep for a tiny amount of time, use
'n * time.Nanosecond" to signal to staticcheck that you did mean to sleep
for some amount of nanoseconds.

var docSA1005 = `Invalid first argument to exec.Command

os/exec runs programs directly (using variants of the fork and exec
system calls on Unix systems). This shouldn't be confused with running
a command in a shell. The shell will allow for features such as input
redirection, pipes, and general scripting. The shell is also
responsible for splitting the user's input into a program name and its
arguments. For example, the equivalent to

    ls / /tmp

would be

    exec.Command("ls", "/", "/tmp")

If you want to run a command in a shell, consider using something like
the following â€“ but be aware that not all systems, particularly
Windows, will have a /bin/sh program:

    exec.Command("/bin/sh", "-c", "ls | grep Awesome")

var docSA1006 = `Printf with dynamic first argument and no further arguments

Using fmt.Printf with a dynamic first argument can lead to unexpected
output. The first argument is a format string, where certain character
combinations have special meaning. If, for example, a user were to
enter a string such as

    Interest rate: 5%

and you printed it with

fmt.Printf(s)

it would lead to the following output:

  Interest rate: 5%!(NOVERB).

Similarly, forming the first parameter via string concatenation with
user input should be avoided for the same reason. When printing user
input, either use a variant of fmt.Print, or use the %s Printf verb
and pass the string as an argument.

var docSA4020 = `Unreachable case clause in a type switch

In a type switch like the following

    type T struct{}
    func (T) Read(b []byte) (int, error) { return 0, nil }

    var v interface{} = T{}

    switch v.(type) {
    case io.Reader:
        // ...
    case T:
        // unreachable
    }

the second case clause can never be reached because T implements
io.Reader and case clauses are evaluated in source order.

Another example:

    type T struct{}
    func (T) Read(b []byte) (int, error) { return 0, nil }
    func (T) Close() error { return nil }

    var v interface{} = T{}

    switch v.(type) {
    case io.Reader:
        // ...
    case io.ReadCloser:
        // unreachable
    }

Even though T has a Close method and thus implements io.ReadCloser,
io.Reader will always match first. The method set of io.Reader is a
subset of io.ReadCloser. Thus it is impossible to match the second
case without mtching the first case.


Structurally equivalent interfaces

A special case of the previous example are structurally identical
interfaces. Given these declarations

    type T error
    type V error

    func doSomething() error {
        err, ok := doAnotherThing()
        if ok {
            return T(err)
        }

        return U(err)
    }

the following type switch will have an unreachable case clause:

    switch doSomething().(type) {
    case T:
        // ...
    case V:
        // unreachable
    }

T will always match before V because they are structurally equivalent
and therefore doSomething()'s return value implements both.

A finalizer is a function associated with an object that runs when the
garbage collector is ready to collect said object, that is when the
object is no longer referenced by anything.

If the finalizer references the object, however, it will always remain
as the final reference to that object, preventing the garbage
collector from collecting the object. The finalizer will never run,
and the object will never be collected, leading to a memory leak. That
is why the finalizer should instead use its first argument to operate
on the object. That way, the number of references can temporarily go
to zero before the object is being passed to the finalizer.

A function that calls itself recursively needs to have an exit

This issue can be caused by simple bugs such as forgetting to add an

safe to use. Go, however, does not implement TCO, and as such a loop

var docSA6001 = `Missing an optimization opportunity when indexing maps by byte slices

Map keys must be comparable, which precludes the use of byte slices.
This usually leads to using string keys and converting byte slices to
strings.

Normally, a conversion of a byte slice to a string needs to copy the data and
causes allocations. The compiler, however, recognizes m[string(b)] and
uses the data of b directly, without copying it, because it knows that
the data can't change during the map lookup. This leads to the
counter-intuitive situation that

    k := string(b)
    println(m[k])
    println(m[k])

will be less efficient than

    println(m[string(b)])
    println(m[string(b)])

because the first version needs to copy and allocate, while the second
one does not.

A sync.Pool is used to avoid unnecessary allocations and reduce the
amount of work the garbage collector has to do.

When passing a value that is not a pointer to a function that accepts
an interface, the value needs to be placed on the heap, which means an
additional allocation. Slices are a common thing to put in sync.Pools,
and they're structs with 3 fields (length, capacity, and a pointer to
an array). In order to avoid the extra allocation, one should store a
pointer to the slice instead.

You may want to loop over the runes in a string. Instead of converting
the string to a slice of runes and looping over that, you can loop
over the string itself. That is,

    for _, r := range s {}

and

    for _, r := range []rune(s) {}

will yield the same values. The first version, however, will be faster
and avoid unnecessary memory allocations.

Do note that if you are interested in the indices, ranging over a
string and over a slice of runes will yield different indices. The
first one yields byte offsets, while the second one yields indices in
the slice of runes.

Converting two strings to the same case and comparing them like so

    if strings.ToLower(s1) == strings.ToLower(s2) {

is significantly more expensive than comparing them with
strings.EqualFold(s1, s2). This is due to memory usage as well as
computational complexity.

strings.ToLower will have to allocate memory for the new strings, as
well as convert both strings fully, even if they differ on the very
first byte. strings.EqualFold, on the other hand, compares the strings
one character at a time. It doesn't need to create two intermediate
strings and can return as soon as the first non-matching character has
been found.

In a constant declaration such as the following:

    const (
        First byte = 1

the constant Second does not have the same type as the constant First.
This construct shouldn't be confused with

    const (
        First byte = iota
        Second
    )

where First and Second do indeed have the same type. The type is only
passed on when no explicit value is assigned to the constant.

When declaring enumerations with explicit values it is therefore
important not to write

    const (
          EnumFirst EnumType = 1
          EnumSecond         = 2
          EnumThird          = 3
    )

This discrepancy in types can cause various confusing behaviors and
bugs.


Wrong type in variable declarations

The most obvious issue with such incorrect enumerations expresses
itself as a compile error:

package pkg

    const (
        EnumFirst  uint8 = 1
        EnumSecond       = 2
    )

    func fn(useFirst bool) {
        x := EnumSecond
        if useFirst {
            x = EnumFirst
        }
    }

fails to compile with

    ./const.go:11:5: cannot use EnumFirst (type uint8) as type int in assignment


Losing method sets

A more subtle issue occurs with types that have methods and optional
interfaces. Consider the following:

    package main

    import "fmt"

    type Enum int

    func (e Enum) String() string {
        return "an enum"
    }

    const (
        EnumFirst  Enum = 1
        EnumSecond      = 2
    )

    func main() {
        fmt.Println(EnumFirst)
        fmt.Println(EnumSecond)
    }

This code will output

    an enum
    2

as EnumSecond has no explicit type, and thus defaults to int.
