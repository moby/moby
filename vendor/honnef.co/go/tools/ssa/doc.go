// Package ssa defines a representation of the elements of Go programs
// (packages, types, functions, variables and constants) using a
// static single-assignment (SSA) form intermediate representation
// (IR) for the bodies of functions.
//
// THIS INTERFACE IS EXPERIMENTAL AND IS LIKELY TO CHANGE.
//
// For an introduction to SSA form, see
// http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Static_single_assignment_form.
// This page provides a broader reading list:
// http://www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~jsinger/ssa.html.
//
// The level of abstraction of the SSA form is intentionally close to
// the source language to facilitate construction of source analysis
// tools.  It is not intended for machine code generation.
//
// All looping, branching and switching constructs are replaced with
// unstructured control flow.  Higher-level control flow constructs
// such as multi-way branch can be reconstructed as needed; see
// ssautil.Switches() for an example.
//
// To construct an SSA-form program, call ssautil.CreateProgram on a
// loader.Program, a set of type-checked packages created from
// parsed Go source files.  The resulting ssa.Program contains all the
// packages and their members, but SSA code is not created for
// function bodies until a subsequent call to (*Package).Build.
//
// The builder initially builds a naive SSA form in which all local
// variables are addresses of stack locations with explicit loads and
// stores.  Registerisation of eligible locals and φ-node insertion
// using dominance and dataflow are then performed as a second pass
// called "lifting" to improve the accuracy and performance of
// subsequent analyses; this pass can be skipped by setting the
// NaiveForm builder flag.
//
// The primary interfaces of this package are:
//
//    - Member: a named member of a Go package.
//    - Value: an expression that yields a value.
//    - Instruction: a statement that consumes values and performs computation.
//    - Node: a Value or Instruction (emphasizing its membership in the SSA value graph)
//
// A computation that yields a result implements both the Value and
// Instruction interfaces.  The following table shows for each
// concrete type which of these interfaces it implements.

// Other key types in this package include: Program, Package, Function
// and BasicBlock.
//
// The program representation constructed by this package is fully
// resolved internally, i.e. it does not rely on the names of Values,
// Packages, Functions, Types or BasicBlocks for the correct
// interpretation of the program.  Only the identities of objects and
// the topology of the SSA and type graphs are semantically
// significant.  (There is one exception: Ids, used to identify field
// and method names, contain strings.)  Avoidance of name-based
// operations simplifies the implementation of subsequent passes and
// can make them very efficient.  Many objects are nonetheless named
// to aid in debugging, but it is not essential that the names be
// either accurate or unambiguous.  The public API exposes a number of
// name-based maps for client convenience.
//
// The ssa/ssautil package provides various utilities that depend only
// on the public API of this package.
