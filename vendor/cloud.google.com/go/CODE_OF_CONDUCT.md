We are committed to making participation in this project
a harassment-free experience for everyone,
regardless of level of experience, gender, gender identity and expression,

* Publishing other's private information,
such as physical or electronic

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct.

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior
may be reported by opening an issue
