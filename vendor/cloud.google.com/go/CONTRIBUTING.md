# Contributing

1. Sign one of the contributor license agreements below.
1. `go get golang.org/x/review/git-codereview` to install the code reviewing
tool.
    1. You will need to ensure that your `GOBIN` directory (by default
    `$GOPATH/bin`) is in your `PATH` so that git can find the command.
    1. If you would like, you may want to set up aliases for git-codereview,
    such that `git codereview change` becomes `git change`. See the
    [godoc](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/review/git-codereview) for details.
    1. Should you run into issues with the git-codereview tool, please note
    that all error messages will assume that you have set up these aliases.
1. Get the cloud package by running `go get -d cloud.google.com/go`.
    1. If you have already checked out the source, make sure that the remote
    git origin is https://code.googlesource.com/gocloud:

        ```
        git remote set-url origin https://code.googlesource.com/gocloud
        ```

1. Make sure your auth is configured correctly by visiting
https://code.googlesource.com, clicking "Generate Password", and following the
directions.
1. Make changes and create a change by running `git codereview change <name>`,
provide a commit message, and use `git codereview mail` to create a Gerrit CL.
1. Keep amending to the change with `git codereview change` and mail as your
receive feedback. Each new mailed amendment will create a new patch set for
your change in Gerrit.
    - Note: if your change includes a breaking change, our breaking change
    detector will cause CI/CD to fail. If your breaking change is acceptable
    in some way, add BREAKING_CHANGE_ACCEPTABLE=<reason> to cause the
    detector not to be run and to make it clear why that is acceptable.

## Integration Tests

In addition to the unit tests, you may run the integration test suite. These
directions describe setting up your environment to run integration tests for
_all_ packages: note that many of these instructions may be redundant if you
intend only to run integration tests on a single package.

#### GCP Setup

To run the integrations tests, creation and configuration of two projects in
the Google Developers Console is required: one specifically for Firestore
integration tests, and another for all other integration tests. We'll refer to
these projects as "general project" and "Firestore project".

After creating each project, you must [create a service account](https://developers.google.com/identity/protocols/OAuth2ServiceAccount#creatinganaccount)
for each project. Ensure the project-level **Owner**
[IAM role](console.cloud.google.com/iam-admin/iam/project) role is added to
each service account. During the creation of the service account, you should
download the JSON credential file for use later.

Next, ensure the following APIs are enabled in the general project:

- BigQuery API
- BigQuery Data Transfer API
- Cloud Dataproc API
- Cloud Dataproc Control API Private
- Cloud Datastore API
- Cloud Firestore API
- Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) API
- Cloud Natural Language API
- Cloud OS Login API
- Cloud Pub/Sub API
- Cloud Resource Manager API
- Cloud Spanner API
- Cloud Speech API
- Cloud Translation API
- Cloud Video Intelligence API
- Cloud Vision API
- Compute Engine API
- Compute Engine Instance Group Manager API
- Container Registry API
- Firebase Rules API
- Google Cloud APIs
- Google Cloud Deployment Manager V2 API
- Google Cloud SQL
- Google Cloud Storage
- Google Cloud Storage JSON API
- Google Compute Engine Instance Group Updater API
- Google Compute Engine Instance Groups API
- Kubernetes Engine API
- Stackdriver Error Reporting API

Next, create a Datastore database in the general project, and a Firestore
database in the Firestore project.

Finally, in the general project, create an API key for the translate API:

- Go to GCP Developer Console.
- Navigate to APIs & Services > Credentials.
- Click Create Credentials > API Key.
- Save this key for use in `GCLOUD_TESTS_API_KEY` as described below.

#### Local Setup

Once the two projects are created and configured, set the following environment
variables:

- `GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_PROJECT_ID`: Developers Console project's ID (e.g.
bamboo-shift-455) for the general project.
- `GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_KEY`: The path to the JSON key file of the general
project's service account.
- `GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_FIRESTORE_PROJECT_ID`: Developers Console project's ID
(e.g. doorway-cliff-677) for the Firestore project.
- `GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_FIRESTORE_KEY`: The path to the JSON key file of the
Firestore project's service account.
- `GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_KEYRING`: The full name of the keyring for the tests,
in the form
"projects/P/locations/L/keyRings/R". The creation of this is described below.
- `GCLOUD_TESTS_API_KEY`: API key for using the Translate API.
- `GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_ZONE`: Compute Engine zone.

Install the [gcloud command-line tool][gcloudcli] to your machine and use it to
create some resources used in integration tests.

From the project's root directory:

``` sh
# Sets the default project in your env.
$ gcloud config set project $GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_PROJECT_ID

# Authenticates the gcloud tool with your account.
$ gcloud auth login

# Create the indexes used in the datastore integration tests.
$ gcloud datastore indexes create datastore/testdata/index.yaml

# Creates a Google Cloud storage bucket with the same name as your test project,
# and with the Stackdriver Logging service account as owner, for the sink
# integration tests in logging.
$ gsutil mb gs://$GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_PROJECT_ID
$ gsutil acl ch -g cloud-logs@google.com:O gs://$GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_PROJECT_ID

# Creates a PubSub topic for integration tests of storage notifications.
$ gcloud beta pubsub topics create go-storage-notification-test
# Next, go to the Pub/Sub dashboard in GCP console. Authorize the user
# "service-<numberic project id>@gs-project-accounts.iam.gserviceaccount.com"
# as a publisher to that topic.

# Creates a Spanner instance for the spanner integration tests.
$ gcloud beta spanner instances create go-integration-test --config regional-us-central1 --nodes 10 --description 'Instance for go client test'
# NOTE: Spanner instances are priced by the node-hour, so you may want to
# delete the instance after testing with 'gcloud beta spanner instances delete'.

$ export MY_KEYRING=some-keyring-name
$ export MY_LOCATION=global
# Creates a KMS keyring, in the same location as the default location for your
# project's buckets.
$ gcloud kms keyrings create $MY_KEYRING --location $MY_LOCATION
# Creates two keys in the keyring, named key1 and key2.
$ gcloud kms keys create key1 --keyring $MY_KEYRING --location $MY_LOCATION --purpose encryption
$ gcloud kms keys create key2 --keyring $MY_KEYRING --location $MY_LOCATION --purpose encryption
# Sets the GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_KEYRING environment variable.
$ export GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_KEYRING=projects/$GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_PROJECT_ID/locations/$MY_LOCATION/keyRings/$MY_KEYRING
# Authorizes Google Cloud Storage to encrypt and decrypt using key1.
gsutil kms authorize -p $GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_PROJECT_ID -k $GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_KEYRING/cryptoKeys/key1
```

#### Running

Once you've done the necessary setup, you can run the integration tests by
running:

``` sh
$ go test -v cloud.google.com/go/...
```

#### Replay

Some packages can record the RPCs during integration tests to a file for
subsequent replay. To record, pass the `-record` flag to `go test`. The
recording will be saved to the _package_`.replay` file. To replay integration
tests from a saved recording, the replay file must be present, the `-short`
flag must be passed to `go test`, and the `GCLOUD_TESTS_GOLANG_ENABLE_REPLAY`
environment variable must have a non-empty value.
