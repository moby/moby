** that allows an application to run multiple statements of SQL
** without having to use a lot of C code. 
**
** ^The sqlite3_exec() interface runs zero or more UTF-8 encoded,
** semicolon-separate SQL statements passed into its 2nd argument,
** in the context of the [database connection] passed in as its 1st
** argument.  ^If the callback function of the 3rd argument to
** sqlite3_exec() is not NULL, then it is invoked for each result row
** coming out of the evaluated SQL statements.  ^The 4th argument to
** sqlite3_exec() is relayed through to the 1st argument of each
** callback invocation.  ^If the callback pointer to sqlite3_exec()
** is NULL, then no callback is ever invoked and result rows are
** ignored.
**
** ^If an error occurs while evaluating the SQL statements passed into
** sqlite3_exec(), then execution of the current statement stops and
** subsequent statements are skipped.  ^If the 5th parameter to sqlite3_exec()
** is not NULL then any error message is written into memory obtained
** from [sqlite3_malloc()] and passed back through the 5th parameter.
** To avoid memory leaks, the application should invoke [sqlite3_free()]
** on error message strings returned through the 5th parameter of
** of sqlite3_exec() after the error message string is no longer needed.
** ^If the 5th parameter to sqlite3_exec() is not NULL and no errors
** occur, then sqlite3_exec() sets the pointer in its 5th parameter to
** NULL before returning.
**
** ^If an sqlite3_exec() callback returns non-zero, the sqlite3_exec()
** routine returns SQLITE_ABORT without invoking the callback again and
** without running any subsequent SQL statements.
**
** ^The 2nd argument to the sqlite3_exec() callback function is the
** number of columns in the result.  ^The 3rd argument to the sqlite3_exec()
** callback is an array of pointers to strings obtained as if from
** [sqlite3_column_text()], one for each column.  ^If an element of a
** result row is NULL then the corresponding string pointer for the
** sqlite3_exec() callback is a NULL pointer.  ^The 4th argument to the
** sqlite3_exec() callback is an array of pointers to strings where each
** entry represents the name of corresponding result column as obtained
** from [sqlite3_column_name()].
**
** ^If the 2nd parameter to sqlite3_exec() is a NULL pointer, a pointer
** to an empty string, or a pointer that contains only whitespace and/or 
** SQL comments, then no SQL statements are evaluated and the database
** is not changed.

** CAPI3REF: OS Interface File Virtual Methods Object
**
** Every file opened by the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method populates an
** [sqlite3_file] object (or, more commonly, a subclass of the
** [sqlite3_file] object) with a pointer to an instance of this object.
** This object defines the methods used to perform various operations
** against the open file represented by the [sqlite3_file] object.
**
** If the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] method sets the sqlite3_file.pMethods element 
** to a non-NULL pointer, then the sqlite3_io_methods.xClose method
** may be invoked even if the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] reported that it failed.  The
** only way to prevent a call to xClose following a failed [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]
** is for the [sqlite3_vfs.xOpen] to set the sqlite3_file.pMethods element
** to NULL.
**
** The flags argument to xSync may be one of [SQLITE_SYNC_NORMAL] or
** [SQLITE_SYNC_FULL].  The first choice is the normal fsync().
** The second choice is a Mac OS X style fullsync.  The [SQLITE_SYNC_DATAONLY]
** flag may be ORed in to indicate that only the data of the file
** and not its inode needs to be synced.
**
** The integer values to xLock() and xUnlock() are one of
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED],
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or
** <li> [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE].
** </ul>
** xLock() increases the lock. xUnlock() decreases the lock.
** The xCheckReservedLock() method checks whether any database connection,
** either in this process or in some other process, is holding a RESERVED,
** PENDING, or EXCLUSIVE lock on the file.  It returns true
** if such a lock exists and false otherwise.
**
** The xFileControl() method is a generic interface that allows custom
** VFS implementations to directly control an open file using the
** [sqlite3_file_control()] interface.  The second "op" argument is an
** integer opcode.  The third argument is a generic pointer intended to
** point to a structure that may contain arguments or space in which to
** write return values.  Potential uses for xFileControl() might be
** functions to enable blocking locks with timeouts, to change the
** locking strategy (for example to use dot-file locks), to inquire
** about the status of a lock, or to break stale locks.  The SQLite
** core reserves all opcodes less than 100 for its own use.
** A [SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCKSTATE | list of opcodes] less than 100 is available.
** Applications that define a custom xFileControl method should use opcodes
** greater than 100 to avoid conflicts.  VFS implementations should
** return [SQLITE_NOTFOUND] for file control opcodes that they do not
** recognize.
**
** The xSectorSize() method returns the sector size of the
** device that underlies the file.  The sector size is the
** minimum write that can be performed without disturbing
** other bytes in the file.  The xDeviceCharacteristics()
** method returns a bit vector describing behaviors of the
** underlying device:
**
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC512]

** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC64K]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND]
** <li> [SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL]
** </ul>
**
** The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMIC property means that all writes of
** any size are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_ATOMICnnn values
** mean that writes of blocks that are nnn bytes in size and
** are aligned to an address which is an integer multiple of
** nnn are atomic.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SAFE_APPEND value means
** that when data is appended to a file, the data is appended
** first then the size of the file is extended, never the other
** way around.  The SQLITE_IOCAP_SEQUENTIAL property means that
** information is written to disk in the same order as calls
** to xWrite().
**
** If xRead() returns SQLITE_IOERR_SHORT_READ it must also fill
** in the unread portions of the buffer with zeros.  A VFS that
** fails to zero-fill short reads might seem to work.  However,
** failure to zero-fill short reads will eventually lead to

** CAPI3REF: Standard File Control Opcodes
**
** These integer constants are opcodes for the xFileControl method
** of the [sqlite3_io_methods] object and for the [sqlite3_file_control()]
** interface.
**
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_LOCKSTATE] opcode is used for debugging.  This
** opcode causes the xFileControl method to write the current state of
** the lock (one of [SQLITE_LOCK_NONE], [SQLITE_LOCK_SHARED],
** [SQLITE_LOCK_RESERVED], [SQLITE_LOCK_PENDING], or [SQLITE_LOCK_EXCLUSIVE])
** into an integer that the pArg argument points to. This capability
** is used during testing and only needs to be supported when SQLITE_TEST
** is defined.
** <ul>
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SIZE_HINT] opcode is used by SQLite to give the VFS
** layer a hint of how large the database file will grow to be during the
** current transaction.  This hint is not guaranteed to be accurate but it
** is often close.  The underlying VFS might choose to preallocate database
** file space based on this hint in order to help writes to the database
** file run faster.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_CHUNK_SIZE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_CHUNK_SIZE] opcode is used to request that the VFS
** extends and truncates the database file in chunks of a size specified
** by the user. The fourth argument to [sqlite3_file_control()] should 
** point to an integer (type int) containing the new chunk-size to use
** for the nominated database. Allocating database file space in large
** chunks (say 1MB at a time), may reduce file-system fragmentation and
** improve performance on some systems.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_FILE_POINTER] opcode is used to obtain a pointer
** to the [sqlite3_file] object associated with a particular database
** connection.  See the [sqlite3_file_control()] documentation for
** additional information.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC_OMITTED]]
** No longer in use.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_SYNC] opcode is generated internally by SQLite and
** sent to the VFS immediately before the xSync method is invoked on a
** database file descriptor. Or, if the xSync method is not invoked 
** because the user has configured SQLite with 
** [PRAGMA synchronous | PRAGMA synchronous=OFF] it is invoked in place 
** of the xSync method. In most cases, the pointer argument passed with
** this file-control is NULL. However, if the database file is being synced
** as part of a multi-database commit, the argument points to a nul-terminated
** string containing the transactions master-journal file name. VFSes that 
** do not need this signal should silently ignore this opcode. Applications 
** should not call [sqlite3_file_control()] with this opcode as doing so may 
** disrupt the operation of the specialized VFSes that do require it.  
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_PHASETWO]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_COMMIT_PHASETWO] opcode is generated internally by SQLite
** and sent to the VFS after a transaction has been committed immediately
** but before the database is unlocked. VFSes that do not need this signal
** should silently ignore this opcode. Applications should not call
** [sqlite3_file_control()] with this opcode as doing so may disrupt the 
** operation of the specialized VFSes that do require it.  
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_AV_RETRY]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_AV_RETRY] opcode is used to configure automatic
** retry counts and intervals for certain disk I/O operations for the
** windows [VFS] in order to provide robustness in the presence of
** anti-virus programs.  By default, the windows VFS will retry file read,
** file write, and file delete operations up to 10 times, with a delay
** of 25 milliseconds before the first retry and with the delay increasing
** by an additional 25 milliseconds with each subsequent retry.  This
** opcode allows these two values (10 retries and 25 milliseconds of delay)
** to be adjusted.  The values are changed for all database connections
** within the same process.  The argument is a pointer to an array of two
** integers where the first integer i the new retry count and the second
** integer is the delay.  If either integer is negative, then the setting
** is not changed but instead the prior value of that setting is written
** into the array entry, allowing the current retry settings to be
** interrogated.  The zDbName parameter is ignored.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_PERSIST_WAL] opcode is used to set or query the
** persistent [WAL | Write Ahead Log] setting.  By default, the auxiliary
** write ahead log and shared memory files used for transaction control
** are automatically deleted when the latest connection to the database
** closes.  Setting persistent WAL mode causes those files to persist after
** close.  Persisting the files is useful when other processes that do not
** have write permission on the directory containing the database file want
** to read the database file, as the WAL and shared memory files must exist
** in order for the database to be readable.  The fourth parameter to
** [sqlite3_file_control()] for this opcode should be a pointer to an integer.
** That integer is 0 to disable persistent WAL mode or 1 to enable persistent
** WAL mode.  If the integer is -1, then it is overwritten with the current
** WAL persistence setting.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE] opcode is used to set or query the
** persistent "powersafe-overwrite" or "PSOW" setting.  The PSOW setting
** determines the [SQLITE_IOCAP_POWERSAFE_OVERWRITE] bit of the
** xDeviceCharacteristics methods. The fourth parameter to
** [sqlite3_file_control()] for this opcode should be a pointer to an integer.
** That integer is 0 to disable zero-damage mode or 1 to enable zero-damage
** mode.  If the integer is -1, then it is overwritten with the current
** zero-damage mode setting.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_OVERWRITE]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_OVERWRITE] opcode is invoked by SQLite after opening
** a write transaction to indicate that, unless it is rolled back for some
** reason, the entire database file will be overwritten by the current 
** transaction. This is used by VACUUM operations.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_VFSNAME]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_VFSNAME] opcode can be used to obtain the names of
** all [VFSes] in the VFS stack.  The names are of all VFS shims and the
** final bottom-level VFS are written into memory obtained from 
** [sqlite3_malloc()] and the result is stored in the char* variable
** that the fourth parameter of [sqlite3_file_control()] points to.
** The caller is responsible for freeing the memory when done.  As with
** all file-control actions, there is no guarantee that this will actually
** do anything.  Callers should initialize the char* variable to a NULL
** pointer in case this file-control is not implemented.  This file-control
** is intended for diagnostic use only.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]]
** ^Whenever a [PRAGMA] statement is parsed, an [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] 
** file control is sent to the open [sqlite3_file] object corresponding
** to the database file to which the pragma statement refers. ^The argument
** to the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control is an array of
** pointers to strings (char**) in which the second element of the array
** is the name of the pragma and the third element is the argument to the
** pragma or NULL if the pragma has no argument.  ^The handler for an
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control can optionally make the first element
** of the char** argument point to a string obtained from [sqlite3_mprintf()]
** or the equivalent and that string will become the result of the pragma or
** the error message if the pragma fails. ^If the
** [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control returns [SQLITE_NOTFOUND], then normal 
** [PRAGMA] processing continues.  ^If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
** file control returns [SQLITE_OK], then the parser assumes that the
** VFS has handled the PRAGMA itself and the parser generates a no-op
** prepared statement.  ^If the [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA] file control returns
** any result code other than [SQLITE_OK] or [SQLITE_NOTFOUND], that means
** that the VFS encountered an error while handling the [PRAGMA] and the
** compilation of the PRAGMA fails with an error.  ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_PRAGMA]
** file control occurs at the beginning of pragma statement analysis and so
** it is able to override built-in [PRAGMA] statements.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_BUSYHANDLER]]
** ^The [SQLITE_FCNTL_BUSYHANDLER]
** file-control may be invoked by SQLite on the database file handle
** shortly after it is opened in order to provide a custom VFS with access
** to the connections busy-handler callback. The argument is of type (void **)
** - an array of two (void *) values. The first (void *) actually points
** to a function of type (int (*)(void *)). In order to invoke the connections
** busy-handler, this function should be invoked with the second (void *) in
** the array as the only argument. If it returns non-zero, then the operation
** should be retried. If it returns zero, the custom VFS should abandon the
** current operation.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_TEMPFILENAME]]
** ^Application can invoke the [SQLITE_FCNTL_TEMPFILENAME] file-control
** to have SQLite generate a
** temporary filename using the same algorithm that is followed to generate
** temporary filenames for TEMP tables and other internal uses.  The
** argument should be a char** which will be filled with the filename
** written into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].  The caller should
** invoke [sqlite3_free()] on the result to avoid a memory leak.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_MMAP_SIZE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_MMAP_SIZE] file control is used to query or set the
** maximum number of bytes that will be used for memory-mapped I/O.
** The argument is a pointer to a value of type sqlite3_int64 that
** is an advisory maximum number of bytes in the file to memory map.  The
** pointer is overwritten with the old value.  The limit is not changed if
** the value originally pointed to is negative, and so the current limit 
** can be queried by passing in a pointer to a negative number.  This
** file-control is used internally to implement [PRAGMA mmap_size].
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_TRACE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_TRACE] file control provides advisory information
** to the VFS about what the higher layers of the SQLite stack are doing.
** This file control is used by some VFS activity tracing [shims].
** The argument is a zero-terminated string.  Higher layers in the
** SQLite stack may generate instances of this file control if
** the [SQLITE_USE_FCNTL_TRACE] compile-time option is enabled.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_HAS_MOVED]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_HAS_MOVED] file control interprets its argument as a
** pointer to an integer and it writes a boolean into that integer depending
** on whether or not the file has been renamed, moved, or deleted since it
** was first opened.
**
** <li>[[SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_SET_HANDLE]]
** The [SQLITE_FCNTL_WIN32_SET_HANDLE] opcode is used for debugging.  This
** opcode causes the xFileControl method to swap the file handle with the one
** pointed to by the pArg argument.  This capability is used during testing
** and only needs to be supported when SQLITE_TEST is defined.

** CAPI3REF: OS Interface Object
**
** An instance of the sqlite3_vfs object defines the interface between
** the SQLite core and the underlying operating system.  The "vfs"
** in the name of the object stands for "virtual file system".  See
** the [VFS | VFS documentation] for further information.
**
** The value of the iVersion field is initially 1 but may be larger in
** future versions of SQLite.  Additional fields may be appended to this
** object when the iVersion value is increased.  Note that the structure
** of the sqlite3_vfs object changes in the transaction between
** SQLite version 3.5.9 and 3.6.0 and yet the iVersion field was not
** modified.
**
** The szOsFile field is the size of the subclassed [sqlite3_file]
** structure used by this VFS.  mxPathname is the maximum length of
** a pathname in this VFS.
**
** Registered sqlite3_vfs objects are kept on a linked list formed by
** the pNext pointer.  The [sqlite3_vfs_register()]
** and [sqlite3_vfs_unregister()] interfaces manage this list
** in a thread-safe way.  The [sqlite3_vfs_find()] interface
** searches the list.  Neither the application code nor the VFS
** implementation should use the pNext pointer.
**
** The pNext field is the only field in the sqlite3_vfs
** structure that SQLite will ever modify.  SQLite will only access
** or modify this field while holding a particular static mutex.
** The application should never modify anything within the sqlite3_vfs
** object once the object has been registered.
**
** The zName field holds the name of the VFS module.  The name must
** be unique across all VFS modules.
**
** [[sqlite3_vfs.xOpen]]
** ^SQLite guarantees that the zFilename parameter to xOpen
** is either a NULL pointer or string obtained
** from xFullPathname() with an optional suffix added.
** ^If a suffix is added to the zFilename parameter, it will
** consist of a single "-" character followed by no more than
** 11 alphanumeric and/or "-" characters.
** ^SQLite further guarantees that
** the string will be valid and unchanged until xClose() is
** called. Because of the previous sentence,
** the [sqlite3_file] can safely store a pointer to the
** filename if it needs to remember the filename for some reason.
** If the zFilename parameter to xOpen is a NULL pointer then xOpen
** must invent its own temporary name for the file.  ^Whenever the 
** xFilename parameter is NULL it will also be the case that the
** flags parameter will include [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE].
**
** The flags argument to xOpen() includes all bits set in
** the flags argument to [sqlite3_open_v2()].  Or if [sqlite3_open()]
** or [sqlite3_open16()] is used, then flags includes at least
** [SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE]. 
** If xOpen() opens a file read-only then it sets *pOutFlags to
** include [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY].  Other bits in *pOutFlags may be set.
**
** ^(SQLite will also add one of the following flags to the xOpen()
** call, depending on the object being opened:
**
** <ul>
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MAIN_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TEMP_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_TRANSIENT_DB]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_SUBJOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_MASTER_JOURNAL]
** <li>  [SQLITE_OPEN_WAL]
** </ul>)^
**
** The file I/O implementation can use the object type flags to
** change the way it deals with files.  For example, an application
** that does not care about crash recovery or rollback might make
** the open of a journal file a no-op.  Writes to this journal would
** also be no-ops, and any attempt to read the journal would return
** SQLITE_IOERR.  Or the implementation might recognize that a database
** file will be doing page-aligned sector reads and writes in a random
** order and set up its I/O subsystem accordingly.
**
** SQLite might also add one of the following flags to the xOpen method:
**
** <ul>
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** <li> [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE]
** </ul>
**
** The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE] flag means the file should be
** deleted when it is closed.  ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_DELETEONCLOSE]
** will be set for TEMP databases and their journals, transient
** databases, and subjournals.
**
** ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE] flag is always used in conjunction
** with the [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE] flag, which are both directly
** analogous to the O_EXCL and O_CREAT flags of the POSIX open()
** API.  The SQLITE_OPEN_EXCLUSIVE flag, when paired with the 
** SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE, is used to indicate that file should always
** be created, and that it is an error if it already exists.
** It is <i>not</i> used to indicate the file should be opened 
** for exclusive access.
**
** ^At least szOsFile bytes of memory are allocated by SQLite
** to hold the  [sqlite3_file] structure passed as the third
** argument to xOpen.  The xOpen method does not have to
** allocate the structure; it should just fill it in.  Note that
** the xOpen method must set the sqlite3_file.pMethods to either
** a valid [sqlite3_io_methods] object or to NULL.  xOpen must do
** this even if the open fails.  SQLite expects that the sqlite3_file.pMethods
** element will be valid after xOpen returns regardless of the success
** or failure of the xOpen call.
**
** [[sqlite3_vfs.xAccess]]
** ^The flags argument to xAccess() may be [SQLITE_ACCESS_EXISTS]
** to test for the existence of a file, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READWRITE] to
** test whether a file is readable and writable, or [SQLITE_ACCESS_READ]
** to test whether a file is at least readable.   The file can be a
** directory.
**
** ^SQLite will always allocate at least mxPathname+1 bytes for the
** output buffer xFullPathname.  The exact size of the output buffer
** is also passed as a parameter to both  methods. If the output buffer
** is not large enough, [SQLITE_CANTOPEN] should be returned. Since this is
** handled as a fatal error by SQLite, vfs implementations should endeavor
** to prevent this by setting mxPathname to a sufficiently large value.
**
** The xRandomness(), xSleep(), xCurrentTime(), and xCurrentTimeInt64()
** interfaces are not strictly a part of the filesystem, but they are
** included in the VFS structure for completeness.
** The xRandomness() function attempts to return nBytes bytes
** of good-quality randomness into zOut.  The return value is
** the actual number of bytes of randomness obtained.
** The xSleep() method causes the calling thread to sleep for at
** least the number of microseconds given.  ^The xCurrentTime()
** method returns a Julian Day Number for the current date and time as
** a floating point value.
** ^The xCurrentTimeInt64() method returns, as an integer, the Julian
** Day Number multiplied by 86400000 (the number of milliseconds in 
** a 24-hour day).  
** ^SQLite will use the xCurrentTimeInt64() method to get the current
** date and time if that method is available (if iVersion is 2 or 
** greater and the function pointer is not NULL) and will fall back
** to xCurrentTime() if xCurrentTimeInt64() is unavailable.
**
** ^The xSetSystemCall(), xGetSystemCall(), and xNestSystemCall() interfaces
** are not used by the SQLite core.  These optional interfaces are provided
** by some VFSes to facilitate testing of the VFS code. By overriding 
** system calls with functions under its control, a test program can
** simulate faults and error conditions that would otherwise be difficult
** or impossible to induce.  The set of system calls that can be overridden
** varies from one VFS to another, and from one version of the same VFS to the
** next.  Applications that use these interfaces must be prepared for any
** or all of these interfaces to be NULL or for their behavior to change
** from one release to the next.  Applications must not attempt to access
** any of these methods if the iVersion of the VFS is less than 3.

/*
** CAPI3REF: Initialize The SQLite Library
**
** ^The sqlite3_initialize() routine initializes the
** SQLite library.  ^The sqlite3_shutdown() routine
** deallocates any resources that were allocated by sqlite3_initialize().
** These routines are designed to aid in process initialization and
** shutdown on embedded systems.  Workstation applications using
** SQLite normally do not need to invoke either of these routines.
**
** A call to sqlite3_initialize() is an "effective" call if it is
** the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked during the lifetime of
** the process, or if it is the first time sqlite3_initialize() is invoked
** following a call to sqlite3_shutdown().  ^(Only an effective call
** of sqlite3_initialize() does any initialization.  All other calls
** are harmless no-ops.)^
**
** A call to sqlite3_shutdown() is an "effective" call if it is the first
** call to sqlite3_shutdown() since the last sqlite3_initialize().  ^(Only
** an effective call to sqlite3_shutdown() does any deinitialization.
** All other valid calls to sqlite3_shutdown() are harmless no-ops.)^
**
** The sqlite3_initialize() interface is threadsafe, but sqlite3_shutdown()
** is not.  The sqlite3_shutdown() interface must only be called from a
** single thread.  All open [database connections] must be closed and all
** other SQLite resources must be deallocated prior to invoking
** sqlite3_shutdown().
**
** Among other things, ^sqlite3_initialize() will invoke
** sqlite3_os_init().  Similarly, ^sqlite3_shutdown()
** will invoke sqlite3_os_end().
**
** ^The sqlite3_initialize() routine returns [SQLITE_OK] on success.
** ^If for some reason, sqlite3_initialize() is unable to initialize
** the library (perhaps it is unable to allocate a needed resource such
** as a mutex) it returns an [error code] other than [SQLITE_OK].
**
** ^The sqlite3_initialize() routine is called internally by many other
** SQLite interfaces so that an application usually does not need to
** invoke sqlite3_initialize() directly.  For example, [sqlite3_open()]
** calls sqlite3_initialize() so the SQLite library will be automatically
** initialized when [sqlite3_open()] is called if it has not be initialized
** already.  ^However, if SQLite is compiled with the [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT]
** compile-time option, then the automatic calls to sqlite3_initialize()
** are omitted and the application must call sqlite3_initialize() directly
** prior to using any other SQLite interface.  For maximum portability,
** it is recommended that applications always invoke sqlite3_initialize()
** directly prior to using any other SQLite interface.  Future releases
** of SQLite may require this.  In other words, the behavior exhibited
** when SQLite is compiled with [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTOINIT] might become the
** default behavior in some future release of SQLite.
**
** The sqlite3_os_init() routine does operating-system specific
** initialization of the SQLite library.  The sqlite3_os_end()
** routine undoes the effect of sqlite3_os_init().  Typical tasks
** performed by these routines include allocation or deallocation
** of static resources, initialization of global variables,
** setting up a default [sqlite3_vfs] module, or setting up
** a default configuration using [sqlite3_config()].
**
** The application should never invoke either sqlite3_os_init()
** or sqlite3_os_end() directly.  The application should only invoke
** sqlite3_initialize() and sqlite3_shutdown().  The sqlite3_os_init()
** interface is called automatically by sqlite3_initialize() and
** sqlite3_os_end() is called by sqlite3_shutdown().  Appropriate
** implementations for sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end()
** are built into SQLite when it is compiled for Unix, Windows, or OS/2.
** When [custom builds | built for other platforms]
** (using the [SQLITE_OS_OTHER=1] compile-time
** option) the application must supply a suitable implementation for
** sqlite3_os_init() and sqlite3_os_end().  An application-supplied
** implementation of sqlite3_os_init() or sqlite3_os_end()
** must return [SQLITE_OK] on success and some other [error code] upon

** provided to support rare applications with unusual needs.
**
** The sqlite3_config() interface is not threadsafe.  The application

/*
** CAPI3REF: Memory Allocation Routines
**
** An instance of this object defines the interface between SQLite
** and low-level memory allocation routines.
**
** This object is used in only one place in the SQLite interface.
** A pointer to an instance of this object is the argument to
** [sqlite3_config()] when the configuration option is
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MALLOC] or [SQLITE_CONFIG_GETMALLOC].  
** By creating an instance of this object
** and passing it to [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_MALLOC])
** during configuration, an application can specify an alternative
** memory allocation subsystem for SQLite to use for all of its
** dynamic memory needs.
**
** Note that SQLite comes with several [built-in memory allocators]
** that are perfectly adequate for the overwhelming majority of applications
** and that this object is only useful to a tiny minority of applications
** with specialized memory allocation requirements.  This object is
** also used during testing of SQLite in order to specify an alternative
** memory allocator that simulates memory out-of-memory conditions in
** order to verify that SQLite recovers gracefully from such
** conditions.
**
** The xMalloc, xRealloc, and xFree methods must work like the
** malloc(), realloc() and free() functions from the standard C library.
** ^SQLite guarantees that the second argument to
** xRealloc is always a value returned by a prior call to xRoundup.
**
** xSize should return the allocated size of a memory allocation
** previously obtained from xMalloc or xRealloc.  The allocated size
** is always at least as big as the requested size but may be larger.
**
** The xRoundup method returns what would be the allocated size of
** a memory allocation given a particular requested size.  Most memory
** allocators round up memory allocations at least to the next multiple
** of 8.  Some allocators round up to a larger multiple or to a power of 2.
** Every memory allocation request coming in through [sqlite3_malloc()]
** or [sqlite3_realloc()] first calls xRoundup.  If xRoundup returns 0, 
** that causes the corresponding memory allocation to fail.
**
** The xInit method initializes the memory allocator.  For example,
** it might allocate any require mutexes or initialize internal data
** structures.  The xShutdown method is invoked (indirectly) by
** [sqlite3_shutdown()] and should deallocate any resources acquired
** by xInit.  The pAppData pointer is used as the only parameter to
** xInit and xShutdown.
**
** SQLite holds the [SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER] mutex when it invokes
** the xInit method, so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.  The
** xShutdown method is only called from [sqlite3_shutdown()] so it does
** not need to be threadsafe either.  For all other methods, SQLite
** holds the [SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM] mutex as long as the
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS] configuration option is turned on (which
** it is by default) and so the methods are automatically serialized.
** However, if [SQLITE_CONFIG_MEMSTATUS] is disabled, then the other
** methods must be threadsafe or else make their own arrangements for
** serialization.
**
** SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening
** call to xShutdown().

/*
** CAPI3REF: Convenience Routines For Running Queries
**
** This is a legacy interface that is preserved for backwards compatibility.
** Use of this interface is not recommended.
**
** Definition: A <b>result table</b> is memory data structure created by the
** [sqlite3_get_table()] interface.  A result table records the
** complete query results from one or more queries.
**
** The table conceptually has a number of rows and columns.  But
** these numbers are not part of the result table itself.  These
** numbers are obtained separately.  Let N be the number of rows
** and M be the number of columns.
**
** A result table is an array of pointers to zero-terminated UTF-8 strings.
** There are (N+1)*M elements in the array.  The first M pointers point
** to zero-terminated strings that  contain the names of the columns.
** The remaining entries all point to query results.  NULL values result
** in NULL pointers.  All other values are in their UTF-8 zero-terminated
** string representation as returned by [sqlite3_column_text()].
**
** A result table might consist of one or more memory allocations.
** It is not safe to pass a result table directly to [sqlite3_free()].
** A result table should be deallocated using [sqlite3_free_table()].
**
** ^(As an example of the result table format, suppose a query result
** is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        Name        | Age
**        -----------------------
**        Alice       | 43
**        Bob         | 28
**        Cindy       | 21
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** There are two column (M==2) and three rows (N==3).  Thus the
** result table has 8 entries.  Suppose the result table is stored
** in an array names azResult.  Then azResult holds this content:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**        azResult&#91;0] = "Name";
**        azResult&#91;1] = "Age";
**        azResult&#91;2] = "Alice";
**        azResult&#91;3] = "43";
**        azResult&#91;4] = "Bob";
**        azResult&#91;5] = "28";
**        azResult&#91;6] = "Cindy";
**        azResult&#91;7] = "21";
** </pre></blockquote>)^
**
** ^The sqlite3_get_table() function evaluates one or more
** semicolon-separated SQL statements in the zero-terminated UTF-8
** string of its 2nd parameter and returns a result table to the
** pointer given in its 3rd parameter.
**
** After the application has finished with the result from sqlite3_get_table(),
** it must pass the result table pointer to sqlite3_free_table() in order to
** release the memory that was malloced.  Because of the way the
** [sqlite3_malloc()] happens within sqlite3_get_table(), the calling
** function must not try to call [sqlite3_free()] directly.  Only
** [sqlite3_free_table()] is able to release the memory properly and safely.
**
** The sqlite3_get_table() interface is implemented as a wrapper around
** [sqlite3_exec()].  The sqlite3_get_table() routine does not have access
** to any internal data structures of SQLite.  It uses only the public
** interface defined here.  As a consequence, errors that occur in the
** wrapper layer outside of the internal [sqlite3_exec()] call are not
** reflected in subsequent calls to [sqlite3_errcode()] or
** [sqlite3_errmsg()].

** CAPI3REF: Formatted String Printing Functions
**
** These routines are work-alikes of the "printf()" family of functions
** from the standard C library.
**
** ^The sqlite3_mprintf() and sqlite3_vmprintf() routines write their
** results into memory obtained from [sqlite3_malloc()].
** The strings returned by these two routines should be
** released by [sqlite3_free()].  ^Both routines return a
** NULL pointer if [sqlite3_malloc()] is unable to allocate enough
** memory to hold the resulting string.
**
** ^(The sqlite3_snprintf() routine is similar to "snprintf()" from
** the standard C library.  The result is written into the
** buffer supplied as the second parameter whose size is given by
** the first parameter. Note that the order of the
** first two parameters is reversed from snprintf().)^  This is an
** historical accident that cannot be fixed without breaking
** backwards compatibility.  ^(Note also that sqlite3_snprintf()
** returns a pointer to its buffer instead of the number of
** characters actually written into the buffer.)^  We admit that
** the number of characters written would be a more useful return
** value but we cannot change the implementation of sqlite3_snprintf()
** now without breaking compatibility.
**
** ^As long as the buffer size is greater than zero, sqlite3_snprintf()
** guarantees that the buffer is always zero-terminated.  ^The first
** parameter "n" is the total size of the buffer, including space for
** the zero terminator.  So the longest string that can be completely
** written will be n-1 characters.
**
** ^The sqlite3_vsnprintf() routine is a varargs version of sqlite3_snprintf().
**
** These routines all implement some additional formatting
** options that are useful for constructing SQL statements.
** All of the usual printf() formatting options apply.  In addition, there
** is are "%q", "%Q", and "%z" options.
**
** ^(The %q option works like %s in that it substitutes a nul-terminated
** string from the argument list.  But %q also doubles every '\'' character.
** %q is designed for use inside a string literal.)^  By doubling each '\''
** character it escapes that character and allows it to be inserted into
** the string.
**
** For example, assume the string variable zText contains text as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zText = "It's a happy day!";
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** One can use this text in an SQL statement as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES('%q')", zText);
**  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite3_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** Because the %q format string is used, the '\'' character in zText
** is escaped and the SQL generated is as follows:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It''s a happy day!')
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This is correct.  Had we used %s instead of %q, the generated SQL
** would have looked like this:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  INSERT INTO table1 VALUES('It's a happy day!');
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** This second example is an SQL syntax error.  As a general rule you should
** always use %q instead of %s when inserting text into a string literal.
**
** ^(The %Q option works like %q except it also adds single quotes around
** the outside of the total string.  Additionally, if the parameter in the
** argument list is a NULL pointer, %Q substitutes the text "NULL" (without
** single quotes).)^  So, for example, one could say:
**
** <blockquote><pre>
**  char *zSQL = sqlite3_mprintf("INSERT INTO table VALUES(%Q)", zText);
**  sqlite3_exec(db, zSQL, 0, 0, 0);
**  sqlite3_free(zSQL);
** </pre></blockquote>
**
** The code above will render a correct SQL statement in the zSQL
** variable even if the zText variable is a NULL pointer.
**
** ^(The "%z" formatting option works like "%s" but with the
** addition that after the string has been read and copied into
** the result, [sqlite3_free()] is called on the input string.)^

** a NULL pointer.
**
** ^Calling sqlite3_free() with a pointer previously returned
** by sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc() releases that memory so

** Memory corruption, a segmentation fault, or other severe error
** might result if sqlite3_free() is called with a non-NULL pointer that
** was not obtained from sqlite3_malloc() or sqlite3_realloc().
**
** ^(The sqlite3_realloc() interface attempts to resize a
** prior memory allocation to be at least N bytes, where N is the

** parameter.)^ ^ If the first parameter to sqlite3_realloc()

** ^If the second parameter to sqlite3_realloc() is zero or
** negative then the behavior is exactly the same as calling
** sqlite3_free(P) where P is the first parameter to sqlite3_realloc().
** ^sqlite3_realloc() returns a pointer to a memory allocation
** of at least N bytes in size or NULL if sufficient memory is unavailable.
** ^If M is the size of the prior allocation, then min(N,M) bytes

** ^If sqlite3_realloc() returns NULL, then the prior allocation

** [sqlite3_prepare16()] and [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()].  ^At various
** points during the compilation process, as logic is being created

** see if those actions are allowed.  ^The authorizer callback should
** return [SQLITE_OK] to allow the action, [SQLITE_IGNORE] to disallow the
** specific action but allow the SQL statement to continue to be
** compiled, or [SQLITE_DENY] to cause the entire SQL statement to be
** rejected with an error.  ^If the authorizer callback returns
** any value other than [SQLITE_IGNORE], [SQLITE_OK], or [SQLITE_DENY]
** then the [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or equivalent call that triggered
** the authorizer will fail with an error message.
**
** When the callback returns [SQLITE_OK], that means the operation
** requested is ok.  ^When the callback returns [SQLITE_DENY], the
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or equivalent call that triggered the
** authorizer will fail with an error message explaining that
** access is denied. 
**
** ^The first parameter to the authorizer callback is a copy of the third
** parameter to the sqlite3_set_authorizer() interface. ^The second parameter
** to the callback is an integer [SQLITE_COPY | action code] that specifies
** the particular action to be authorized. ^The third through sixth parameters
** to the callback are zero-terminated strings that contain additional
** details about the action to be authorized.
**
** ^If the action code is [SQLITE_READ]
** and the callback returns [SQLITE_IGNORE] then the
** [prepared statement] statement is constructed to substitute
** a NULL value in place of the table column that would have
** been read if [SQLITE_OK] had been returned.  The [SQLITE_IGNORE]
** return can be used to deny an untrusted user access to individual
** columns of a table.
** ^If the action code is [SQLITE_DELETE] and the callback returns
** [SQLITE_IGNORE] then the [DELETE] operation proceeds but the
** [truncate optimization] is disabled and all rows are deleted individually.
**
** An authorizer is used when [sqlite3_prepare | preparing]
** SQL statements from an untrusted source, to ensure that the SQL statements
** do not try to access data they are not allowed to see, or that they do not
** try to execute malicious statements that damage the database.  For
** example, an application may allow a user to enter arbitrary
** SQL queries for evaluation by a database.  But the application does
** not want the user to be able to make arbitrary changes to the
** database.  An authorizer could then be put in place while the
** user-entered SQL is being [sqlite3_prepare | prepared] that
** disallows everything except [SELECT] statements.
**
** Applications that need to process SQL from untrusted sources
** might also consider lowering resource limits using [sqlite3_limit()]
** and limiting database size using the [max_page_count] [PRAGMA]
** in addition to using an authorizer.
**
** ^(Only a single authorizer can be in place on a database connection
** at a time.  Each call to sqlite3_set_authorizer overrides the

/*
** CAPI3REF: Opening A New Database Connection
**
** ^These routines open an SQLite database file as specified by the 
** filename argument. ^The filename argument is interpreted as UTF-8 for
** sqlite3_open() and sqlite3_open_v2() and as UTF-16 in the native byte
** order for sqlite3_open16(). ^(A [database connection] handle is usually
** returned in *ppDb, even if an error occurs.  The only exception is that
** if SQLite is unable to allocate memory to hold the [sqlite3] object,
** a NULL will be written into *ppDb instead of a pointer to the [sqlite3]
** object.)^ ^(If the database is opened (and/or created) successfully, then
** [SQLITE_OK] is returned.  Otherwise an [error code] is returned.)^ ^The
** [sqlite3_errmsg()] or [sqlite3_errmsg16()] routines can be used to obtain
** an English language description of the error following a failure of any
** of the sqlite3_open() routines.
**
** ^The default encoding for the database will be UTF-8 if
** sqlite3_open() or sqlite3_open_v2() is called and
** UTF-16 in the native byte order if sqlite3_open16() is used.
**
** Whether or not an error occurs when it is opened, resources
** associated with the [database connection] handle should be released by
** passing it to [sqlite3_close()] when it is no longer required.
**
** The sqlite3_open_v2() interface works like sqlite3_open()
** except that it accepts two additional parameters for additional control
** over the new database connection.  ^(The flags parameter to
** sqlite3_open_v2() can take one of
** the following three values, optionally combined with the 
** [SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX], [SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX], [SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE],
** [SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE], and/or [SQLITE_OPEN_URI] flags:)^
**

** ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY]</dt>
** <dd>The database is opened in read-only mode.  If the database does not
** already exist, an error is returned.</dd>)^
**
** ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE]</dt>
** <dd>The database is opened for reading and writing if possible, or reading
** only if the file is write protected by the operating system.  In either
** case the database must already exist, otherwise an error is returned.</dd>)^
**
** ^(<dt>[SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE] | [SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE]</dt>
** <dd>The database is opened for reading and writing, and is created if
** it does not already exist. This is the behavior that is always used for
** sqlite3_open() and sqlite3_open16().</dd>)^
** </dl>
**
** If the 3rd parameter to sqlite3_open_v2() is not one of the
** combinations shown above optionally combined with other
** [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY | SQLITE_OPEN_* bits]
** then the behavior is undefined.
**
** ^If the [SQLITE_OPEN_NOMUTEX] flag is set, then the database connection
** opens in the multi-thread [threading mode] as long as the single-thread
** mode has not been set at compile-time or start-time.  ^If the
** [SQLITE_OPEN_FULLMUTEX] flag is set then the database connection opens
** in the serialized [threading mode] unless single-thread was
** previously selected at compile-time or start-time.
** ^The [SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE] flag causes the database connection to be
** eligible to use [shared cache mode], regardless of whether or not shared
** cache is enabled using [sqlite3_enable_shared_cache()].  ^The
** [SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE] flag causes the database connection to not
** participate in [shared cache mode] even if it is enabled.
**
** ^The fourth parameter to sqlite3_open_v2() is the name of the
** [sqlite3_vfs] object that defines the operating system interface that
** the new database connection should use.  ^If the fourth parameter is
** a NULL pointer then the default [sqlite3_vfs] object is used.
**
** ^If the filename is ":memory:", then a private, temporary in-memory database
** is created for the connection.  ^This in-memory database will vanish when
** the database connection is closed.  Future versions of SQLite might
** make use of additional special filenames that begin with the ":" character.
** It is recommended that when a database filename actually does begin with
** a ":" character you should prefix the filename with a pathname such as
** "./" to avoid ambiguity.
**
** ^If the filename is an empty string, then a private, temporary
** on-disk database will be created.  ^This private database will be
** automatically deleted as soon as the database connection is closed.
**
** [[URI filenames in sqlite3_open()]] <h3>URI Filenames</h3>
**
** ^If [URI filename] interpretation is enabled, and the filename argument
** begins with "file:", then the filename is interpreted as a URI. ^URI
** filename interpretation is enabled if the [SQLITE_OPEN_URI] flag is
** set in the fourth argument to sqlite3_open_v2(), or if it has
** been enabled globally using the [SQLITE_CONFIG_URI] option with the
** [sqlite3_config()] method or by the [SQLITE_USE_URI] compile-time option.
** As of SQLite version 3.7.7, URI filename interpretation is turned off
** by default, but future releases of SQLite might enable URI filename
** interpretation by default.  See "[URI filenames]" for additional
** information.
**
** URI filenames are parsed according to RFC 3986. ^If the URI contains an
** authority, then it must be either an empty string or the string 
** "localhost". ^If the authority is not an empty string or "localhost", an 
** error is returned to the caller. ^The fragment component of a URI, if 
** present, is ignored.
**
** ^SQLite uses the path component of the URI as the name of the disk file
** which contains the database. ^If the path begins with a '/' character, 
** then it is interpreted as an absolute path. ^If the path does not begin 
** with a '/' (meaning that the authority section is omitted from the URI)
** then the path is interpreted as a relative path. 
** ^On windows, the first component of an absolute path 
** is a drive specification (e.g. "C:").
**
** [[core URI query parameters]]
** The query component of a URI may contain parameters that are interpreted
** either by SQLite itself, or by a [VFS | custom VFS implementation].
** SQLite interprets the following three query parameters:
**
** <ul>
**   <li> <b>vfs</b>: ^The "vfs" parameter may be used to specify the name of
**     a VFS object that provides the operating system interface that should
**     be used to access the database file on disk. ^If this option is set to
**     an empty string the default VFS object is used. ^Specifying an unknown
**     VFS is an error. ^If sqlite3_open_v2() is used and the vfs option is
**     present, then the VFS specified by the option takes precedence over
**     the value passed as the fourth parameter to sqlite3_open_v2().
**
**   <li> <b>mode</b>: ^(The mode parameter may be set to either "ro", "rw",
**     "rwc", or "memory". Attempting to set it to any other value is
**     an error)^. 
**     ^If "ro" is specified, then the database is opened for read-only 
**     access, just as if the [SQLITE_OPEN_READONLY] flag had been set in the 
**     third argument to sqlite3_open_v2(). ^If the mode option is set to 
**     "rw", then the database is opened for read-write (but not create) 
**     access, as if SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE (but not SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE) had 
**     been set. ^Value "rwc" is equivalent to setting both 
**     SQLITE_OPEN_READWRITE and SQLITE_OPEN_CREATE.  ^If the mode option is
**     set to "memory" then a pure [in-memory database] that never reads
**     or writes from disk is used. ^It is an error to specify a value for
**     the mode parameter that is less restrictive than that specified by
**     the flags passed in the third parameter to sqlite3_open_v2().
**
**   <li> <b>cache</b>: ^The cache parameter may be set to either "shared" or
**     "private". ^Setting it to "shared" is equivalent to setting the
**     SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE bit in the flags argument passed to
**     sqlite3_open_v2(). ^Setting the cache parameter to "private" is 
**     equivalent to setting the SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE bit.
**     ^If sqlite3_open_v2() is used and the "cache" parameter is present in
**     a URI filename, its value overrides any behavior requested by setting
**     SQLITE_OPEN_PRIVATECACHE or SQLITE_OPEN_SHAREDCACHE flag.
**
**  <li> <b>psow</b>: ^The psow parameter may be "true" (or "on" or "yes" or
**     "1") or "false" (or "off" or "no" or "0") to indicate that the
**     [powersafe overwrite] property does or does not apply to the
**     storage media on which the database file resides.  ^The psow query
**     parameter only works for the built-in unix and Windows VFSes.
**
**  <li> <b>nolock</b>: ^The nolock parameter is a boolean query parameter
**     which if set disables file locking in rollback journal modes.  This
**     is useful for accessing a database on a filesystem that does not
**     support locking.  Caution:  Database corruption might result if two
**     or more processes write to the same database and any one of those
**     processes uses nolock=1.
**
**  <li> <b>immutable</b>: ^The immutable parameter is a boolean query
**     parameter that indicates that the database file is stored on
**     read-only media.  ^When immutable is set, SQLite assumes that the
**     database file cannot be changed, even by a process with higher
**     privilege, and so the database is opened read-only and all locking
**     and change detection is disabled.  Caution: Setting the immutable
**     property on a database file that does in fact change can result
**     in incorrect query results and/or [SQLITE_CORRUPT] errors.
**     See also: [SQLITE_IOCAP_IMMUTABLE].
**       
** </ul>
**
** ^Specifying an unknown parameter in the query component of a URI is not an
** error.  Future versions of SQLite might understand additional query
** parameters.  See "[query parameters with special meaning to SQLite]" for
** additional information.

** CAPI3REF: Compiling An SQL Statement
** KEYWORDS: {SQL statement compiler}
**
** To execute an SQL query, it must first be compiled into a byte-code
** program using one of these routines.
**
** The first argument, "db", is a [database connection] obtained from a
** prior successful call to [sqlite3_open()], [sqlite3_open_v2()] or
** [sqlite3_open16()].  The database connection must not have been closed.
**
** The second argument, "zSql", is the statement to be compiled, encoded
** as either UTF-8 or UTF-16.  The sqlite3_prepare() and sqlite3_prepare_v2()
** interfaces use UTF-8, and sqlite3_prepare16() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2()
** use UTF-16.
**
** ^If the nByte argument is less than zero, then zSql is read up to the
** first zero terminator. ^If nByte is non-negative, then it is the maximum
** number of  bytes read from zSql.  ^When nByte is non-negative, the
** zSql string ends at either the first '\000' or '\u0000' character or
** the nByte-th byte, whichever comes first. If the caller knows
** that the supplied string is nul-terminated, then there is a small
** performance advantage to be gained by passing an nByte parameter that
** is equal to the number of bytes in the input string <i>including</i>
** the nul-terminator bytes as this saves SQLite from having to
** make a copy of the input string.
**
** ^If pzTail is not NULL then *pzTail is made to point to the first byte
** past the end of the first SQL statement in zSql.  These routines only
** compile the first statement in zSql, so *pzTail is left pointing to
** what remains uncompiled.
**
** ^*ppStmt is left pointing to a compiled [prepared statement] that can be
** executed using [sqlite3_step()].  ^If there is an error, *ppStmt is set
** to NULL.  ^If the input text contains no SQL (if the input is an empty
** string or a comment) then *ppStmt is set to NULL.
** The calling procedure is responsible for deleting the compiled
** SQL statement using [sqlite3_finalize()] after it has finished with it.
** ppStmt may not be NULL.
**
** ^On success, the sqlite3_prepare() family of routines return [SQLITE_OK];
** otherwise an [error code] is returned.
**
** The sqlite3_prepare_v2() and sqlite3_prepare16_v2() interfaces are
** recommended for all new programs. The two older interfaces are retained
** for backwards compatibility, but their use is discouraged.
** ^In the "v2" interfaces, the prepared statement
** that is returned (the [sqlite3_stmt] object) contains a copy of the
** original SQL text. This causes the [sqlite3_step()] interface to

** </li>
**
** <li>
** ^If the specific value bound to [parameter | host parameter] in the

** ^The index for named parameters can be looked up using the

** ^The NNN value must be between 1 and the [sqlite3_limit()]

** ^If the third parameter to sqlite3_bind_text() or sqlite3_bind_text16()
** or sqlite3_bind_blob() is a NULL pointer then the fourth parameter
** is ignored and the end result is the same as sqlite3_bind_null().

** If the fourth parameter to sqlite3_bind_blob() is negative, then

** The details of the behavior of the sqlite3_step() interface depend
** on whether the statement was prepared using the newer "v2" interface
** [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] or the older legacy
** interface [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()].  The use of the
** new "v2" interface is recommended for new applications but the legacy
** interface will continue to be supported.

** or occurs outside of an explicit transaction, then you can retry the
** statement.  If the statement is not a [COMMIT] and occurs within an
** explicit transaction then you should rollback the transaction before
** continuing.
**
** ^[SQLITE_DONE] means that the statement has finished executing
** successfully.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on this virtual
** machine without first calling [sqlite3_reset()] to reset the virtual
** machine back to its initial state.
**
** ^If the SQL statement being executed returns any data, then [SQLITE_ROW]
** is returned each time a new row of data is ready for processing by the
** caller. The values may be accessed using the [column access functions].
** sqlite3_step() is called again to retrieve the next row of data.
**
** ^[SQLITE_ERROR] means that a run-time error (such as a constraint
** violation) has occurred.  sqlite3_step() should not be called again on
** the VM. More information may be found by calling [sqlite3_errmsg()].
** ^With the legacy interface, a more specific error code (for example,
** [SQLITE_INTERRUPT], [SQLITE_SCHEMA], [SQLITE_CORRUPT], and so forth)
** can be obtained by calling [sqlite3_reset()] on the
** [prepared statement].  ^In the "v2" interface,
** the more specific error code is returned directly by sqlite3_step().
**
** [SQLITE_MISUSE] means that the this routine was called inappropriately.
** Perhaps it was called on a [prepared statement] that has
** already been [sqlite3_finalize | finalized] or on one that had
** previously returned [SQLITE_ERROR] or [SQLITE_DONE].  Or it could
** be the case that the same database connection is being used by two or
** more threads at the same moment in time.
**
** For all versions of SQLite up to and including 3.6.23.1, a call to
** [sqlite3_reset()] was required after sqlite3_step() returned anything
** other than [SQLITE_ROW] before any subsequent invocation of
** sqlite3_step().  Failure to reset the prepared statement using 
** [sqlite3_reset()] would result in an [SQLITE_MISUSE] return from
** sqlite3_step().  But after version 3.6.23.1, sqlite3_step() began
** calling [sqlite3_reset()] automatically in this circumstance rather
** than returning [SQLITE_MISUSE].  This is not considered a compatibility
** break because any application that ever receives an SQLITE_MISUSE error
** is broken by definition.  The [SQLITE_OMIT_AUTORESET] compile-time option
** can be used to restore the legacy behavior.
**
** <b>Goofy Interface Alert:</b> In the legacy interface, the sqlite3_step()

** [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()] in order to find one of the
** specific [error codes] that better describes the error.
** We admit that this is a goofy design.  The problem has been fixed
** with the "v2" interface.  If you prepare all of your SQL statements
** using either [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or [sqlite3_prepare16_v2()] instead
** of the legacy [sqlite3_prepare()] and [sqlite3_prepare16()] interfaces,
** then the more specific [error codes] are returned directly

**
** These routines form the "result set" interface.
**
** ^These routines return information about a single column of the current
** result row of a query.  ^In every case the first argument is a pointer
** to the [prepared statement] that is being evaluated (the [sqlite3_stmt*]
** that was returned from [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] or one of its variants)
** and the second argument is the index of the column for which information
** should be returned. ^The leftmost column of the result set has the index 0.
** ^The number of columns in the result can be determined using
** [sqlite3_column_count()].
**
** If the SQL statement does not currently point to a valid row, or if the
** column index is out of range, the result is undefined.
** These routines may only be called when the most recent call to
** [sqlite3_step()] has returned [SQLITE_ROW] and neither
** [sqlite3_reset()] nor [sqlite3_finalize()] have been called subsequently.
** If any of these routines are called after [sqlite3_reset()] or
** [sqlite3_finalize()] or after [sqlite3_step()] has returned
** something other than [SQLITE_ROW], the results are undefined.
** If [sqlite3_step()] or [sqlite3_reset()] or [sqlite3_finalize()]
** are called from a different thread while any of these routines
** are pending, then the results are undefined.
**
** ^The sqlite3_column_type() routine returns the
** [SQLITE_INTEGER | datatype code] for the initial data type
** of the result column.  ^The returned value is one of [SQLITE_INTEGER],
** [SQLITE_FLOAT], [SQLITE_TEXT], [SQLITE_BLOB], or [SQLITE_NULL].  The value
** returned by sqlite3_column_type() is only meaningful if no type
** conversions have occurred as described below.  After a type conversion,
** the value returned by sqlite3_column_type() is undefined.  Future
** versions of SQLite may change the behavior of sqlite3_column_type()
** following a type conversion.
**
** ^If the result is a BLOB or UTF-8 string then the sqlite3_column_bytes()
** routine returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string.
** ^If the result is a UTF-16 string, then sqlite3_column_bytes() converts
** the string to UTF-8 and then returns the number of bytes.
** ^If the result is a numeric value then sqlite3_column_bytes() uses
** [sqlite3_snprintf()] to convert that value to a UTF-8 string and returns
** the number of bytes in that string.
** ^If the result is NULL, then sqlite3_column_bytes() returns zero.
**
** ^If the result is a BLOB or UTF-16 string then the sqlite3_column_bytes16()
** routine returns the number of bytes in that BLOB or string.
** ^If the result is a UTF-8 string, then sqlite3_column_bytes16() converts
** the string to UTF-16 and then returns the number of bytes.
** ^If the result is a numeric value then sqlite3_column_bytes16() uses
** [sqlite3_snprintf()] to convert that value to a UTF-16 string and returns
** the number of bytes in that string.
** ^If the result is NULL, then sqlite3_column_bytes16() returns zero.
**
** ^The values returned by [sqlite3_column_bytes()] and 
** [sqlite3_column_bytes16()] do not include the zero terminators at the end
** of the string.  ^For clarity: the values returned by
** [sqlite3_column_bytes()] and [sqlite3_column_bytes16()] are the number of
** bytes in the string, not the number of characters.
**
** ^Strings returned by sqlite3_column_text() and sqlite3_column_text16(),
** even empty strings, are always zero-terminated.  ^The return
** value from sqlite3_column_blob() for a zero-length BLOB is a NULL pointer.
**
** ^The object returned by [sqlite3_column_value()] is an
** [unprotected sqlite3_value] object.  An unprotected sqlite3_value object
** may only be used with [sqlite3_bind_value()] and [sqlite3_result_value()].
** If the [unprotected sqlite3_value] object returned by
** [sqlite3_column_value()] is used in any other way, including calls
** to routines like [sqlite3_value_int()], [sqlite3_value_text()],
** or [sqlite3_value_bytes()], then the behavior is undefined.
**
** These routines attempt to convert the value where appropriate.  ^For
** example, if the internal representation is FLOAT and a text result
** is requested, [sqlite3_snprintf()] is used internally to perform the
** conversion automatically.  ^(The following table details the conversions
** that are applied:
**
** <blockquote>

** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>   TEXT    <td> Result is a NULL pointer
** <tr><td>  NULL    <td>   BLOB    <td> Result is a NULL pointer
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>  FLOAT    <td> Convert from integer to float
** <tr><td> INTEGER  <td>   TEXT    <td> ASCII rendering of the integer

** <tr><td>  BLOB    <td>   TEXT    <td> Add a zero terminator if needed
** </table>
** </blockquote>)^
**
** The table above makes reference to standard C library functions atoi()
** and atof().  SQLite does not really use these functions.  It has its
** own equivalent internal routines.  The atoi() and atof() names are
** used in the table for brevity and because they are familiar to most
** C programmers.
**
** Note that when type conversions occur, pointers returned by prior
** calls to sqlite3_column_blob(), sqlite3_column_text(), and/or
** sqlite3_column_text16() may be invalidated.
** Type conversions and pointer invalidations might occur
** in the following cases:
**
** <ul>
** <li> The initial content is a BLOB and sqlite3_column_text() or
**      sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  A zero-terminator might
**      need to be added to the string.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-8 text and sqlite3_column_bytes16() or
**      sqlite3_column_text16() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-16.</li>
** <li> The initial content is UTF-16 text and sqlite3_column_bytes() or
**      sqlite3_column_text() is called.  The content must be converted
**      to UTF-8.</li>
** </ul>
**
** ^Conversions between UTF-16be and UTF-16le are always done in place and do
** not invalidate a prior pointer, though of course the content of the buffer
** that the prior pointer references will have been modified.  Other kinds
** of conversion are done in place when it is possible, but sometimes they
** are not possible and in those cases prior pointers are invalidated.
**
** The safest and easiest to remember policy is to invoke these routines
** in one of the following ways:
**
** <ul>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_blob() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes()</li>
**  <li>sqlite3_column_text16() followed by sqlite3_column_bytes16()</li>
** </ul>
**
** In other words, you should call sqlite3_column_text(),
** sqlite3_column_blob(), or sqlite3_column_text16() first to force the result
** into the desired format, then invoke sqlite3_column_bytes() or
** sqlite3_column_bytes16() to find the size of the result.  Do not mix calls
** to sqlite3_column_text() or sqlite3_column_blob() with calls to
** sqlite3_column_bytes16(), and do not mix calls to sqlite3_column_text16()
** with calls to sqlite3_column_bytes().
**
** ^The pointers returned are valid until a type conversion occurs as
** described above, or until [sqlite3_step()] or [sqlite3_reset()] or
** [sqlite3_finalize()] is called.  ^The memory space used to hold strings
** and BLOBs is freed automatically.  Do <b>not</b> pass the pointers returned
** from [sqlite3_column_blob()], [sqlite3_column_text()], etc. into
** [sqlite3_free()].
**
** ^(If a memory allocation error occurs during the evaluation of any
** of these routines, a default value is returned.  The default value
** is either the integer 0, the floating point number 0.0, or a NULL
** pointer.  Subsequent calls to [sqlite3_errcode()] will return

**
** ^These functions (collectively known as "function creation routines")
** are used to add SQL functions or aggregates or to redefine the behavior
** of existing SQL functions or aggregates.  The only differences between
** these routines are the text encoding expected for
** the second parameter (the name of the function being created)
** and the presence or absence of a destructor callback for
** the application data pointer.
**
** ^The first parameter is the [database connection] to which the SQL
** function is to be added.  ^If an application uses more than one database
** connection then application-defined SQL functions must be added
** to each database connection separately.
**
** ^The second parameter is the name of the SQL function to be created or
** redefined.  ^The length of the name is limited to 255 bytes in a UTF-8
** representation, exclusive of the zero-terminator.  ^Note that the name
** length limit is in UTF-8 bytes, not characters nor UTF-16 bytes.  
** ^Any attempt to create a function with a longer name
** will result in [SQLITE_MISUSE] being returned.
**
** ^The third parameter (nArg)
** is the number of arguments that the SQL function or
** aggregate takes. ^If this parameter is -1, then the SQL function or
** aggregate may take any number of arguments between 0 and the limit
** set by [sqlite3_limit]([SQLITE_LIMIT_FUNCTION_ARG]).  If the third
** parameter is less than -1 or greater than 127 then the behavior is
** undefined.
**
** ^The fourth parameter, eTextRep, specifies what
** [SQLITE_UTF8 | text encoding] this SQL function prefers for
** its parameters.  The application should set this parameter to
** [SQLITE_UTF16LE] if the function implementation invokes 
** [sqlite3_value_text16le()] on an input, or [SQLITE_UTF16BE] if the
** implementation invokes [sqlite3_value_text16be()] on an input, or
** [SQLITE_UTF16] if [sqlite3_value_text16()] is used, or [SQLITE_UTF8]
** otherwise.  ^The same SQL function may be registered multiple times using
** different preferred text encodings, with different implementations for
** each encoding.
** ^When multiple implementations of the same function are available, SQLite
** will pick the one that involves the least amount of data conversion.
**
** ^The fourth parameter may optionally be ORed with [SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC]
** to signal that the function will always return the same result given
** the same inputs within a single SQL statement.  Most SQL functions are
** deterministic.  The built-in [random()] SQL function is an example of a
** function that is not deterministic.  The SQLite query planner is able to
** perform additional optimizations on deterministic functions, so use
** of the [SQLITE_DETERMINISTIC] flag is recommended where possible.
**
** ^(The fifth parameter is an arbitrary pointer.  The implementation of the
** function can gain access to this pointer using [sqlite3_user_data()].)^
**
** ^The sixth, seventh and eighth parameters, xFunc, xStep and xFinal, are
** pointers to C-language functions that implement the SQL function or
** aggregate. ^A scalar SQL function requires an implementation of the xFunc
** callback only; NULL pointers must be passed as the xStep and xFinal
** parameters. ^An aggregate SQL function requires an implementation of xStep
** and xFinal and NULL pointer must be passed for xFunc. ^To delete an existing
** SQL function or aggregate, pass NULL pointers for all three function
** callbacks.
**
** ^(If the ninth parameter to sqlite3_create_function_v2() is not NULL,
** then it is destructor for the application data pointer. 
** The destructor is invoked when the function is deleted, either by being
** overloaded or when the database connection closes.)^
** ^The destructor is also invoked if the call to
** sqlite3_create_function_v2() fails.
** ^When the destructor callback of the tenth parameter is invoked, it
** is passed a single argument which is a copy of the application data 
** pointer which was the fifth parameter to sqlite3_create_function_v2().
**
** ^It is permitted to register multiple implementations of the same
** functions with the same name but with either differing numbers of
** arguments or differing preferred text encodings.  ^SQLite will use
** the implementation that most closely matches the way in which the
** SQL function is used.  ^A function implementation with a non-negative
** nArg parameter is a better match than a function implementation with
** a negative nArg.  ^A function where the preferred text encoding
** matches the database encoding is a better
** match than a function where the encoding is different.  
** ^A function where the encoding difference is between UTF16le and UTF16be
** is a closer match than a function where the encoding difference is
** between UTF8 and UTF16.
**
** ^Built-in functions may be overloaded by new application-defined functions.
**
** ^An application-defined function is permitted to call other
** SQLite interfaces.  However, such calls must not

**
** These routines are used by the xFunc or xFinal callbacks that
** implement SQL functions and aggregates.  See
** [sqlite3_create_function()] and [sqlite3_create_function16()]
** for additional information.
**
** These functions work very much like the [parameter binding] family of
** functions used to bind values to host parameters in prepared statements.
** Refer to the [SQL parameter] documentation for additional information.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_blob() interface sets the result from
** an application-defined function to be the BLOB whose content is pointed
** to by the second parameter and which is N bytes long where N is the
** third parameter.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_zeroblob() interfaces set the result of
** the application-defined function to be a BLOB containing all zero
** bytes and N bytes in size, where N is the value of the 2nd parameter.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_double() interface sets the result from
** an application-defined function to be a floating point value specified
** by its 2nd argument.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16() functions
** cause the implemented SQL function to throw an exception.
** ^SQLite uses the string pointed to by the
** 2nd parameter of sqlite3_result_error() or sqlite3_result_error16()
** as the text of an error message.  ^SQLite interprets the error
** message string from sqlite3_result_error() as UTF-8. ^SQLite
** interprets the string from sqlite3_result_error16() as UTF-16 in native
** byte order.  ^If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error()
** or sqlite3_result_error16() is negative then SQLite takes as the error
** message all text up through the first zero character.
** ^If the third parameter to sqlite3_result_error() or
** sqlite3_result_error16() is non-negative then SQLite takes that many
** bytes (not characters) from the 2nd parameter as the error message.
** ^The sqlite3_result_error() and sqlite3_result_error16()
** routines make a private copy of the error message text before
** they return.  Hence, the calling function can deallocate or
** modify the text after they return without harm.
** ^The sqlite3_result_error_code() function changes the error code
** returned by SQLite as a result of an error in a function.  ^By default,
** the error code is SQLITE_ERROR.  ^A subsequent call to sqlite3_result_error()
** or sqlite3_result_error16() resets the error code to SQLITE_ERROR.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_error_toobig() interface causes SQLite to throw an
** error indicating that a string or BLOB is too long to represent.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_error_nomem() interface causes SQLite to throw an
** error indicating that a memory allocation failed.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_int() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be the 32-bit signed integer
** value given in the 2nd argument.
** ^The sqlite3_result_int64() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be the 64-bit signed integer
** value given in the 2nd argument.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_null() interface sets the return value
** of the application-defined function to be NULL.
**
** ^The sqlite3_result_text(), sqlite3_result_text16(),
** sqlite3_result_text16le(), and sqlite3_result_text16be() interfaces
** set the return value of the application-defined function to be
** a text string which is represented as UTF-8, UTF-16 native byte order,
** UTF-16 little endian, or UTF-16 big endian, respectively.
** ^SQLite takes the text result from the application from
** the 2nd parameter of the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces.
** ^If the 3rd parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** is negative, then SQLite takes result text from the 2nd parameter
** through the first zero character.
** ^If the 3rd parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** is non-negative, then as many bytes (not characters) of the text
** pointed to by the 2nd parameter are taken as the application-defined
** function result.  If the 3rd parameter is non-negative, then it
** must be the byte offset into the string where the NUL terminator would
** appear if the string where NUL terminated.  If any NUL characters occur
** in the string at a byte offset that is less than the value of the 3rd
** parameter, then the resulting string will contain embedded NULs and the
** result of expressions operating on strings with embedded NULs is undefined.
** ^If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces
** or sqlite3_result_blob is a non-NULL pointer, then SQLite calls that
** function as the destructor on the text or BLOB result when it has
** finished using that result.
** ^If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces or to
** sqlite3_result_blob is the special constant SQLITE_STATIC, then SQLite
** assumes that the text or BLOB result is in constant space and does not
** copy the content of the parameter nor call a destructor on the content
** when it has finished using that result.
** ^If the 4th parameter to the sqlite3_result_text* interfaces

** <li> [SQLITE_UTF16BE],
** <li> [SQLITE_UTF16], or
** <li> [SQLITE_UTF16_ALIGNED].
** </ul>)^
** ^The eTextRep argument determines the encoding of strings passed
** to the collating function callback, xCallback.
** ^The [SQLITE_UTF16] and [SQLITE_UTF16_ALIGNED] values for eTextRep
** force strings to be UTF16 with native byte order.
** ^The [SQLITE_UTF16_ALIGNED] value for eTextRep forces strings to begin
** on an even byte address.
**
** ^The fourth argument, pArg, is an application data pointer that is passed
** through as the first argument to the collating function callback.
**
** ^The fifth argument, xCallback, is a pointer to the collating function.
** ^Multiple collating functions can be registered using the same name but
** with different eTextRep parameters and SQLite will use whichever
** function requires the least amount of data transformation.
** ^If the xCallback argument is NULL then the collating function is
** deleted.  ^When all collating functions having the same name are deleted,
** that collation is no longer usable.
**
** ^The collating function callback is invoked with a copy of the pArg 
** application data pointer and with two strings in the encoding specified
** by the eTextRep argument.  The collating function must return an
** integer that is negative, zero, or positive
** if the first string is less than, equal to, or greater than the second,
** respectively.  A collating function must always return the same answer
** given the same inputs.  If two or more collating functions are registered
** to the same collation name (using different eTextRep values) then all
** must give an equivalent answer when invoked with equivalent strings.
** The collating function must obey the following properties for all
** strings A, B, and C:
**
** <ol>
** <li> If A==B then B==A.
** <li> If A==B and B==C then A==C.
** <li> If A&lt;B THEN B&gt;A.
** <li> If A&lt;B and B&lt;C then A&lt;C.
** </ol>
**
** If a collating function fails any of the above constraints and that
** collating function is  registered and used, then the behavior of SQLite
** is undefined.
**
** ^The sqlite3_create_collation_v2() works like sqlite3_create_collation()
** with the addition that the xDestroy callback is invoked on pArg when
** the collating function is deleted.
** ^Collating functions are deleted when they are overridden by later
** calls to the collation creation functions or when the
** [database connection] is closed using [sqlite3_close()].
**
** ^The xDestroy callback is <u>not</u> called if the

** sqlite3_create_collation_v2() with a non-NULL xDestroy argument should 
** check the return code and dispose of the application data pointer

** This is different from every other SQLite interface.  The inconsistency

** ^The sqlite3_update_hook() interface registers a callback function

** to be invoked whenever a row is updated, inserted or deleted in
** a rowid table.
** ^Any callback set by a previous call to this function
** for the same database connection is overridden.
**
** ^The second argument is a pointer to the function to invoke when a
** row is updated, inserted or deleted in a rowid table.
** ^The first argument to the callback is a copy of the third argument
** to sqlite3_update_hook().
** ^The second callback argument is one of [SQLITE_INSERT], [SQLITE_DELETE],
** or [SQLITE_UPDATE], depending on the operation that caused the callback
** to be invoked.
** ^The third and fourth arguments to the callback contain pointers to the
** database and table name containing the affected row.
** ^The final callback parameter is the [rowid] of the row.
** ^In the case of an update, this is the [rowid] after the update takes place.
**
** ^(The update hook is not invoked when internal system tables are
** modified (i.e. sqlite_master and sqlite_sequence).)^
** ^The update hook is not invoked when [WITHOUT ROWID] tables are modified.
**
** ^In the current implementation, the update hook
** is not invoked when duplication rows are deleted because of an
** [ON CONFLICT | ON CONFLICT REPLACE] clause.  ^Nor is the update hook
** invoked when rows are deleted using the [truncate optimization].
** The exceptions defined in this paragraph might change in a future
** release of SQLite.
**
** The update hook implementation must not do anything that will modify
** the database connection that invoked the update hook.  Any actions
** to modify the database connection must be deferred until after the
** completion of the [sqlite3_step()] call that triggered the update hook.
** Note that [sqlite3_prepare_v2()] and [sqlite3_step()] both modify their
** database connections for the meaning of "modify" in this paragraph.

** limit by reducing the number of pages held in the page cache

** is advisory only.
**
** ^The return value from sqlite3_soft_heap_limit64() is the size of
** the soft heap limit prior to the call, or negative in the case of an
** error.  ^If the argument N is negative
** then no change is made to the soft heap limit.  Hence, the current
** size of the soft heap limit can be determined by invoking

** application must supply a custom mutex implementation using the
** [SQLITE_CONFIG_MUTEX] option of the sqlite3_config() function
** before calling sqlite3_initialize() or any other public sqlite3_
** function that calls sqlite3_initialize().)^
**
** ^The sqlite3_mutex_alloc() routine allocates a new
** mutex and returns a pointer to it. ^If it returns NULL
** that means that a mutex could not be allocated.  ^SQLite
** will unwind its stack and return an error.  ^(The argument
** to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() is one of these integer constants:
**
** <ul>

** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MASTER
** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_MEM

** <li>  SQLITE_MUTEX_STATIC_LRU2
** </ul>)^
**
** ^The first two constants (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST and SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE)
** cause sqlite3_mutex_alloc() to create
** a new mutex.  ^The new mutex is recursive when SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE
** is used but not necessarily so when SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST is used.
** The mutex implementation does not need to make a distinction
** between SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE and SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST if it does
** not want to.  ^SQLite will only request a recursive mutex in
** cases where it really needs one.  ^If a faster non-recursive mutex
** implementation is available on the host platform, the mutex subsystem
** might return such a mutex in response to SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST.
**
** ^The other allowed parameters to sqlite3_mutex_alloc() (anything other
** than SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST and SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) each return
** a pointer to a static preexisting mutex.  ^Six static mutexes are
** used by the current version of SQLite.  Future versions of SQLite
** may add additional static mutexes.  Static mutexes are for internal

** use only the dynamic mutexes returned by SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST or
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE.
**
** ^Note that if one of the dynamic mutex parameters (SQLITE_MUTEX_FAST
** or SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE) is used then sqlite3_mutex_alloc()
** returns a different mutex on every call.  ^But for the static
** mutex types, the same mutex is returned on every call that has
** the same type number.
**
** ^The sqlite3_mutex_free() routine deallocates a previously
** allocated dynamic mutex.  ^SQLite is careful to deallocate every
** dynamic mutex that it allocates.  The dynamic mutexes must not be in
** use when they are deallocated.  Attempting to deallocate a static
** mutex results in undefined behavior.  ^SQLite never deallocates
** a static mutex.
**
** ^The sqlite3_mutex_enter() and sqlite3_mutex_try() routines attempt
** to enter a mutex.  ^If another thread is already within the mutex,
** sqlite3_mutex_enter() will block and sqlite3_mutex_try() will return
** SQLITE_BUSY.  ^The sqlite3_mutex_try() interface returns [SQLITE_OK]
** upon successful entry.  ^(Mutexes created using
** SQLITE_MUTEX_RECURSIVE can be entered multiple times by the same thread.

** ^The xMutexInit routine is called by SQLite exactly once for each

** ^The xMutexEnd method defined by this structure is invoked as
** part of system shutdown by the sqlite3_shutdown() function. The
** implementation of this method is expected to release all outstanding
** resources obtained by the mutex methods implementation, especially
** those obtained by the xMutexInit method.  ^The xMutexEnd()
** interface is invoked exactly once for each call to [sqlite3_shutdown()].
**
** ^(The remaining seven methods defined by this structure (xMutexAlloc,

**
** ^(The [sqlite3_config]([SQLITE_CONFIG_PCACHE2], ...) interface can
** register an alternative page cache implementation by passing in an 
** instance of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure.)^
** In many applications, most of the heap memory allocated by 
** SQLite is used for the page cache.
** By implementing a 
** custom page cache using this API, an application can better control
** the amount of memory consumed by SQLite, the way in which 
** that memory is allocated and released, and the policies used to 
** determine exactly which parts of a database file are cached and for 
** how long.
**
** The alternative page cache mechanism is an
** extreme measure that is only needed by the most demanding applications.
** The built-in page cache is recommended for most uses.
**
** ^(The contents of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2 structure are copied to an
** internal buffer by SQLite within the call to [sqlite3_config].  Hence
** the application may discard the parameter after the call to
** [sqlite3_config()] returns.)^
**
** [[the xInit() page cache method]]
** ^(The xInit() method is called once for each effective 
** call to [sqlite3_initialize()])^
** (usually only once during the lifetime of the process). ^(The xInit()
** method is passed a copy of the sqlite3_pcache_methods2.pArg value.)^
** The intent of the xInit() method is to set up global data structures 
** required by the custom page cache implementation. 
** ^(If the xInit() method is NULL, then the 
** built-in default page cache is used instead of the application defined
** page cache.)^
**
** [[the xShutdown() page cache method]]
** ^The xShutdown() method is called by [sqlite3_shutdown()].
** It can be used to clean up 
** any outstanding resources before process shutdown, if required.
** ^The xShutdown() method may be NULL.
**
** ^SQLite automatically serializes calls to the xInit method,
** so the xInit method need not be threadsafe.  ^The
** xShutdown method is only called from [sqlite3_shutdown()] so it does
** not need to be threadsafe either.  All other methods must be threadsafe
** in multithreaded applications.
**
** ^SQLite will never invoke xInit() more than once without an intervening
** call to xShutdown().
**
** [[the xCreate() page cache methods]]
** ^SQLite invokes the xCreate() method to construct a new cache instance.
** SQLite will typically create one cache instance for each open database file,
** though this is not guaranteed. ^The
** first parameter, szPage, is the size in bytes of the pages that must
** be allocated by the cache.  ^szPage will always a power of two.  ^The
** second parameter szExtra is a number of bytes of extra storage 
** associated with each page cache entry.  ^The szExtra parameter will
** a number less than 250.  SQLite will use the
** extra szExtra bytes on each page to store metadata about the underlying
** database page on disk.  The value passed into szExtra depends
** on the SQLite version, the target platform, and how SQLite was compiled.
** ^The third argument to xCreate(), bPurgeable, is true if the cache being
** created will be used to cache database pages of a file stored on disk, or
** false if it is used for an in-memory database. The cache implementation
** does not have to do anything special based with the value of bPurgeable;
** it is purely advisory.  ^On a cache where bPurgeable is false, SQLite will
** never invoke xUnpin() except to deliberately delete a page.
** ^In other words, calls to xUnpin() on a cache with bPurgeable set to
** false will always have the "discard" flag set to true.  
** ^Hence, a cache created with bPurgeable false will
** never contain any unpinned pages.
**
** [[the xCachesize() page cache method]]
** ^(The xCachesize() method may be called at any time by SQLite to set the
** suggested maximum cache-size (number of pages stored by) the cache
** instance passed as the first argument. This is the value configured using
** the SQLite "[PRAGMA cache_size]" command.)^  As with the bPurgeable
** parameter, the implementation is not required to do anything with this
** value; it is advisory only.
**
** [[the xPagecount() page cache methods]]
** The xPagecount() method must return the number of pages currently
** stored in the cache, both pinned and unpinned.
** 
** [[the xFetch() page cache methods]]
** The xFetch() method locates a page in the cache and returns a pointer to 
** an sqlite3_pcache_page object associated with that page, or a NULL pointer.
** The pBuf element of the returned sqlite3_pcache_page object will be a
** pointer to a buffer of szPage bytes used to store the content of a 
** single database page.  The pExtra element of sqlite3_pcache_page will be
** a pointer to the szExtra bytes of extra storage that SQLite has requested
** for each entry in the page cache.
**
** The page to be fetched is determined by the key. ^The minimum key value
** is 1.  After it has been retrieved using xFetch, the page is considered
** to be "pinned".
**
** If the requested page is already in the page cache, then the page cache
** implementation must return a pointer to the page buffer with its content
** intact.  If the requested page is not already in the cache, then the
** cache implementation should use the value of the createFlag
** parameter to help it determined what action to take:
**
** <table border=1 width=85% align=center>
** <tr><th> createFlag <th> Behavior when page is not already in cache
** <tr><td> 0 <td> Do not allocate a new page.  Return NULL.
** <tr><td> 1 <td> Allocate a new page if it easy and convenient to do so.
**                 Otherwise return NULL.
** <tr><td> 2 <td> Make every effort to allocate a new page.  Only return
**                 NULL if allocating a new page is effectively impossible.
** </table>
**
** ^(SQLite will normally invoke xFetch() with a createFlag of 0 or 1.  SQLite
** will only use a createFlag of 2 after a prior call with a createFlag of 1
** failed.)^  In between the to xFetch() calls, SQLite may
** attempt to unpin one or more cache pages by spilling the content of
** pinned pages to disk and synching the operating system disk cache.
**
** [[the xUnpin() page cache method]]
** ^xUnpin() is called by SQLite with a pointer to a currently pinned page
** as its second argument.  If the third parameter, discard, is non-zero,
** then the page must be evicted from the cache.
** ^If the discard parameter is
** zero, then the page may be discarded or retained at the discretion of
** page cache implementation. ^The page cache implementation
** may choose to evict unpinned pages at any time.
**
** The cache must not perform any reference counting. A single 
** call to xUnpin() unpins the page regardless of the number of prior calls 
** to xFetch().
**
** [[the xRekey() page cache methods]]
** The xRekey() method is used to change the key value associated with the
** page passed as the second argument. If the cache
** previously contains an entry associated with newKey, it must be
** discarded. ^Any prior cache entry associated with newKey is guaranteed not
** to be pinned.
**
** When SQLite calls the xTruncate() method, the cache must discard all
** existing cache entries with page numbers (keys) greater than or equal
** to the value of the iLimit parameter passed to xTruncate(). If any
** of these pages are pinned, they are implicitly unpinned, meaning that
** they can be safely discarded.
**
** [[the xDestroy() page cache method]]

**
** <b>Concurrent Usage of Database Handles</b>
**
** ^The source [database connection] may be used by the application for other
** purposes while a backup operation is underway or being initialized.
** ^If SQLite is compiled and configured to support threadsafe database
** connections, then the source database connection may be used concurrently
** from within other threads.
**
** However, the application must guarantee that the destination 
** [database connection] is not passed to any other API (by any thread) after 
** sqlite3_backup_init() is called and before the corresponding call to
** sqlite3_backup_finish().  SQLite does not currently check to see
** if the application incorrectly accesses the destination [database connection]
** and so no error code is reported, but the operations may malfunction
** nevertheless.  Use of the destination database connection while a
** backup is in progress might also also cause a mutex deadlock.
**
** If running in [shared cache mode], the application must
** guarantee that the shared cache used by the destination database
** is not accessed while the backup is running. In practice this means
** that the application must guarantee that the disk file being 
** backed up to is not accessed by any connection within the process,
** not just the specific connection that was passed to sqlite3_backup_init().
**
** The [sqlite3_backup] object itself is partially threadsafe. Multiple 
** threads may safely make multiple concurrent calls to sqlite3_backup_step().
** However, the sqlite3_backup_remaining() and sqlite3_backup_pagecount()
** APIs are not strictly speaking threadsafe. If they are invoked at the
** same time as another thread is invoking sqlite3_backup_step() it is
** possible that they return invalid values.

** CAPI3REF: Unlock Notification
**
** ^When running in shared-cache mode, a database operation may fail with
** an [SQLITE_LOCKED] error if the required locks on the shared-cache or
** individual tables within the shared-cache cannot be obtained. See
** [SQLite Shared-Cache Mode] for a description of shared-cache locking. 
** ^This API may be used to register a callback that SQLite will invoke 
** when the connection currently holding the required lock relinquishes it.
** ^This API is only available if the library was compiled with the
** [SQLITE_ENABLE_UNLOCK_NOTIFY] C-preprocessor symbol defined.
**
** See Also: [Using the SQLite Unlock Notification Feature].
**
** ^Shared-cache locks are released when a database connection concludes
** its current transaction, either by committing it or rolling it back. 
**
** ^When a connection (known as the blocked connection) fails to obtain a
** shared-cache lock and SQLITE_LOCKED is returned to the caller, the
** identity of the database connection (the blocking connection) that
** has locked the required resource is stored internally. ^After an 
** application receives an SQLITE_LOCKED error, it may call the
** sqlite3_unlock_notify() method with the blocked connection handle as 
** the first argument to register for a callback that will be invoked
** when the blocking connections current transaction is concluded. ^The
** callback is invoked from within the [sqlite3_step] or [sqlite3_close]
** call that concludes the blocking connections transaction.
**
** ^(If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is called in a multi-threaded application,
** there is a chance that the blocking connection will have already
** concluded its transaction by the time sqlite3_unlock_notify() is invoked.
** If this happens, then the specified callback is invoked immediately,
** from within the call to sqlite3_unlock_notify().)^
**
** ^If the blocked connection is attempting to obtain a write-lock on a
** shared-cache table, and more than one other connection currently holds
** a read-lock on the same table, then SQLite arbitrarily selects one of 
** the other connections to use as the blocking connection.
**
** ^(There may be at most one unlock-notify callback registered by a 
** blocked connection. If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is called when the
** blocked connection already has a registered unlock-notify callback,
** then the new callback replaces the old.)^ ^If sqlite3_unlock_notify() is
** called with a NULL pointer as its second argument, then any existing
** unlock-notify callback is canceled. ^The blocked connections 
** unlock-notify callback may also be canceled by closing the blocked
** connection using [sqlite3_close()].
**
** The unlock-notify callback is not reentrant. If an application invokes
** any sqlite3_xxx API functions from within an unlock-notify callback, a
** crash or deadlock may be the result.
**
** ^Unless deadlock is detected (see below), sqlite3_unlock_notify() always
** returns SQLITE_OK.
**
** <b>Callback Invocation Details</b>
**
** When an unlock-notify callback is registered, the application provides a 
** single void* pointer that is passed to the callback when it is invoked.
** However, the signature of the callback function allows SQLite to pass
** it an array of void* context pointers. The first argument passed to
** an unlock-notify callback is a pointer to an array of void* pointers,
** and the second is the number of entries in the array.
**
** When a blocking connections transaction is concluded, there may be
** more than one blocked connection that has registered for an unlock-notify
** callback. ^If two or more such blocked connections have specified the
** same callback function, then instead of invoking the callback function
** multiple times, it is invoked once with the set of void* context pointers
** specified by the blocked connections bundled together into an array.
** This gives the application an opportunity to prioritize any actions 
** related to the set of unblocked database connections.
**
** <b>Deadlock Detection</b>
**
** Assuming that after registering for an unlock-notify callback a 
** database waits for the callback to be issued before taking any further
** action (a reasonable assumption), then using this API may cause the
** application to deadlock. For example, if connection X is waiting for
** connection Y's transaction to be concluded, and similarly connection
** Y is waiting on connection X's transaction, then neither connection
** will proceed and the system may remain deadlocked indefinitely.
**
** To avoid this scenario, the sqlite3_unlock_notify() performs deadlock
** detection. ^If a given call to sqlite3_unlock_notify() would put the
** system in a deadlocked state, then SQLITE_LOCKED is returned and no
** unlock-notify callback is registered. The system is said to be in
** a deadlocked state if connection A has registered for an unlock-notify
** callback on the conclusion of connection B's transaction, and connection
** B has itself registered for an unlock-notify callback when connection
** A's transaction is concluded. ^Indirect deadlock is also detected, so
** the system is also considered to be deadlocked if connection B has
** registered for an unlock-notify callback on the conclusion of connection
** C's transaction, where connection C is waiting on connection A. ^Any
** number of levels of indirection are allowed.
**
** <b>The "DROP TABLE" Exception</b>
**
** When a call to [sqlite3_step()] returns SQLITE_LOCKED, it is almost 
** always appropriate to call sqlite3_unlock_notify(). There is however,
** one exception. When executing a "DROP TABLE" or "DROP INDEX" statement,
** SQLite checks if there are any currently executing SELECT statements
** that belong to the same connection. If there are, SQLITE_LOCKED is
** returned. In this case there is no "blocking connection", so invoking
** sqlite3_unlock_notify() results in the unlock-notify callback being
** invoked immediately. If the application then re-attempts the "DROP TABLE"
** or "DROP INDEX" query, an infinite loop might be the result.
**
** One way around this problem is to check the extended error code returned
** by an sqlite3_step() call. ^(If there is a blocking connection, then the
** extended error code is set to SQLITE_LOCKED_SHAREDCACHE. Otherwise, in
** the special "DROP TABLE/INDEX" case, the extended error code is just 
** SQLITE_LOCKED.)^

** can use to customize and optimize their behavior.
**
** <dl>
** <dt>SQLITE_VTAB_CONSTRAINT_SUPPORT
** <dd>Calls of the form
** [sqlite3_vtab_config](db,SQLITE_VTAB_CONSTRAINT_SUPPORT,X) are supported,
** where X is an integer.  If X is zero, then the [virtual table] whose
** [xCreate] or [xConnect] method invoked [sqlite3_vtab_config()] does not
** support constraints.  In this configuration (which is the default) if
** a call to the [xUpdate] method returns [SQLITE_CONSTRAINT], then the entire
** statement is rolled back as if [ON CONFLICT | OR ABORT] had been
** specified as part of the users SQL statement, regardless of the actual
** ON CONFLICT mode specified.
**
** If X is non-zero, then the virtual table implementation guarantees
** that if [xUpdate] returns [SQLITE_CONSTRAINT], it will do so before
** any modifications to internal or persistent data structures have been made.
** If the [ON CONFLICT] mode is ABORT, FAIL, IGNORE or ROLLBACK, SQLite 
** is able to roll back a statement or database transaction, and abandon
** or continue processing the current SQL statement as appropriate. 
** If the ON CONFLICT mode is REPLACE and the [xUpdate] method returns
** [SQLITE_CONSTRAINT], SQLite handles this as if the ON CONFLICT mode
** had been ABORT.
**
** Virtual table implementations that are required to handle OR REPLACE
** must do so within the [xUpdate] method. If a call to the 
** [sqlite3_vtab_on_conflict()] function indicates that the current ON 
** CONFLICT policy is REPLACE, the virtual table implementation should 
** silently replace the appropriate rows within the xUpdate callback and
** return SQLITE_OK. Or, if this is not possible, it may return
** SQLITE_CONSTRAINT, in which case SQLite falls back to OR ABORT 
** constraint handling.
