Google API Extensions for Go
============================

[![GoDoc](https://godoc.org/github.com/googleapis/gax-go?status.svg)](https://godoc.org/github.com/googleapis/gax-go)

Google API Extensions for Go (gax-go) is a set of modules which aids the
development of APIs for clients and servers based on `gRPC` and Google API
conventions.

To install the API extensions, use:

```
go get -u github.com/googleapis/gax-go
```

**Note:** Application code will rarely need to use this library directly,
but the code generated automatically from API definition files can use it
to simplify code generation and to provide more convenient and idiomatic API surface.

Go Versions
===========
This library requires Go 1.6 or above.
