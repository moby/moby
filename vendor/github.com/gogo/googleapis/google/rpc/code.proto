  // Service implementors can use the following guidelines to decide

  //      (e.g., when a client-specified test-and-set fails, indicating the
  //      client should restart a read-modify-write sequence).
  //  (c) Use `FAILED_PRECONDITION` if the client should not retry until
  //      the system state has been explicitly fixed.  E.g., if an "rmdir"
  //      fails because the directory is non-empty, `FAILED_PRECONDITION`
  //      should be returned since the client should not retry unless
  //      the files are deleted from the directory.

  // The operation was attempted past the valid range.  E.g., seeking or

  //
  // Unlike `INVALID_ARGUMENT`, this error indicates a problem that may

  // system will generate `INVALID_ARGUMENT` if asked to read at an
  // offset that is not in the range [0,2^32-1], but it will generate
  // `OUT_OF_RANGE` if asked to read from an offset past the current
  // file size.
  //
  // There is a fair bit of overlap between `FAILED_PRECONDITION` and
  // `OUT_OF_RANGE`.  We recommend using `OUT_OF_RANGE` (the more specific
  // error) when it applies so that callers who are iterating through
  // a space can easily look for an `OUT_OF_RANGE` error to detect when
