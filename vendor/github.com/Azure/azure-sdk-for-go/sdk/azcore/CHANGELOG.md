* Documentation improvements
* Simplified `DefaultHTTPClientTransport()` implementation


## 0.12.1 (2020-10-13)
### Features Added
* Update `internal` module dependence to `v0.5.0`


## 0.12.0 (2020-10-08)
### Features Added
* Removed storage specific content
* Removed internal content to prevent API clutter
* Refactored various policy options to conform with our options pattern


## 0.11.0 (2020-09-22)
### Features Added

* Removed `LogError` and `LogSlowResponse`.
* Renamed `options` in `RequestLogOptions`.
* Updated `NewRequestLogPolicy()` to follow standard pattern for options.
* Refactored `requestLogPolicy.Do()` per above changes.
* Cleaned up/added logging in retry policy.
* Export `NewResponseError()`
* Fix `RequestLogOptions` comment


## 0.10.1 (2020-09-17)
### Features Added
* Add default console logger
* Default console logger writes to stderr. To enable it, set env var `AZURE_SDK_GO_LOGGING` to the value 'all'.
* Added `Logger.Writef()` to reduce the need for `ShouldLog()` checks.
* Add `LogLongRunningOperation`


## 0.10.0 (2020-09-10)
### Features Added
* The `request` and `transport` interfaces have been refactored to align with the patterns in the standard library.
* `NewRequest()` now uses `http.NewRequestWithContext()` and performs additional validation, it also requires a context parameter.
* The `Policy` and `Transport` interfaces have had their context parameter removed as the context is associated with the underlying `http.Request`.
* `Pipeline.Do()` will validate the HTTP request before sending it through the pipeline, avoiding retries on a malformed request.
* The `Retrier` interface has been replaced with the `NonRetriableError` interface, and the retry policy updated to test for this.
* `Request.SetBody()` now requires a content type parameter for setting the request's MIME type.
* moved path concatenation into `JoinPaths()` func


## 0.9.6 (2020-08-18)
### Features Added
* Improvements to body download policy
* Always download the response body for error responses, i.e. HTTP status codes >= 400.

### Features Added
* Set the Content-Length header in `Request.SetBody`


## 0.9.4 (2020-08-03)
### Features Added
* Fix cancellation of per try timeout
* Per try timeout is used to ensure that an HTTP operation doesn't take too long, e.g. that a GET on some URL doesn't take an inordinant amount of time.
* Once the HTTP request returns, the per try timeout should be cancelled, not when the response has been read to completion.
* Do not drain response body if there are no more retries
* Do not retry non-idempotent operations when body download fails


## 0.9.3 (2020-07-28)
### Features Added
* Add support for custom HTTP request headers
* Inserts an internal policy into the pipeline that can extract HTTP header values from the caller's context, adding them to the request.
* Use `azcore.WithHTTPHeader` to add HTTP headers to a context.
* Remove method specific to Go 1.14


## 0.9.2 (2020-07-28)
### Features Added
* Omit read-only content from request payloads
* If any field in a payload's object graph contains `azure:"ro"`, make a clone of the object graph, omitting all fields with this annotation.
* Verify no fields were dropped
* Handle embedded struct types
* Added test for cloning by value
* Add messages to failures


## 0.9.1 (2020-07-22)
