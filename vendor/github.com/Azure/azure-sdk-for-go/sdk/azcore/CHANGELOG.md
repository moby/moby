* `NewRequest()` now uses `http.NewRequestWithContext()` and performs additional validation, it also requires a context parameter.
* The `Policy` and `Transport` interfaces have had their context parameter removed as the context is associated with the underlying `http.Request`.
* `Pipeline.Do()` will validate the HTTP request before sending it through the pipeline, avoiding retries on a malformed request.
* The `Retrier` interface has been replaced with the `NonRetriableError` interface, and the retry policy updated to test for this.
* `Request.SetBody()` now requires a content type parameter for setting the request's MIME type.
* moved path concatenation into `JoinPaths()` func


## 0.9.6 (2020-08-18)
### Features Added
* Improvements to body download policy

* Per try timeout is used to ensure that an HTTP operation doesn't take too long, e.g. that a GET on some URL doesn't take an inordinant amount of time.
* Once the HTTP request returns, the per try timeout should be cancelled, not when the response has been read to completion.
* Do not drain response body if there are no more retries
* Do not retry non-idempotent operations when body download fails


## 0.9.3 (2020-07-28)
### Features Added
