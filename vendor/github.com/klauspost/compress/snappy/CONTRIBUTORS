# This is the official list of people who can contribute
# (and typically have contributed) code to the Snappy-Go repository.
# The AUTHORS file lists the copyright holders; this file
# lists people.  For example, Google employees are listed here
# but not in AUTHORS, because Google holds the copyright.
#
# The submission process automatically checks to make sure
# that people submitting code are listed in this file (by email address).
#
# Names should be added to this file only after verifying that
# the individual or the individual's organization has agreed to
# the appropriate Contributor License Agreement, found here:
#
#     http://code.google.com/legal/individual-cla-v1.0.html
#     http://code.google.com/legal/corporate-cla-v1.0.html
#
# The agreement for individuals can be filled out on the web.
#
# When adding J Random Contributor's name to this file,
# either J's name or J's organization's name should be
# added to the AUTHORS file, depending on whether the
# individual or corporate CLA was used.

# Names should be added to this file like so:
#     Name <email address>

# Please keep the list sorted.
