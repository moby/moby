# zstd 

[Zstandard](https://facebook.github.io/zstd/) is a real-time compression algorithm, providing high compression ratios. 
It offers a very wide range of compression / speed trade-off, while being backed by a very fast decoder.
A high performance compression algorithm is implemented. For now focused on speed. 

This package provides [compression](#Compressor) to and [decompression](#Decompressor) of Zstandard content. 

This package is pure Go and without use of "unsafe". 

The `zstd` package is provided as open source software using a Go standard license.

Currently the package is heavily optimized for 64 bit processors and will be significantly slower on 32 bit processors.

## Installation

Install using `go get -u github.com/klauspost/compress`. The package is located in `github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd`.

## Compressor

### Status: 

STABLE - there may always be subtle bugs, a wide variety of content has been tested and the library is actively 
used by several projects. This library is being [fuzz-tested](https://github.com/klauspost/compress-fuzz) for all updates.

There may still be specific combinations of data types/size/settings that could lead to edge cases, 
so as always, testing is recommended.  

For now, a high speed (fastest) and medium-fast (default) compressor has been implemented. 

* The "Fastest" compression ratio is roughly equivalent to zstd level 1. 
* The "Default" compression ratio is roughly equivalent to zstd level 3 (default).
* The "Better" compression ratio is roughly equivalent to zstd level 7.
* The "Best" compression ratio is roughly equivalent to zstd level 11.

In terms of speed, it is typically 2x as fast as the stdlib deflate/gzip in its fastest mode. 
The compression ratio compared to stdlib is around level 3, but usually 3x as fast.

 
### Usage

An Encoder can be used for either compressing a stream via the
`io.WriteCloser` interface supported by the Encoder or as multiple independent
tasks via the `EncodeAll` function.
Smaller encodes are encouraged to use the EncodeAll function.
Use `NewWriter` to create a new instance that can be used for both.

To create a writer with default options, do like this:

```Go
// Compress input to output.
func Compress(in io.Reader, out io.Writer) error {
    enc, err := zstd.NewWriter(out)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    _, err = io.Copy(enc, in)
    if err != nil {
        enc.Close()
        return err
    }
    return enc.Close()
}
```

Now you can encode by writing data to `enc`. The output will be finished writing when `Close()` is called.
Even if your encode fails, you should still call `Close()` to release any resources that may be held up.  

The above is fine for big encodes. However, whenever possible try to *reuse* the writer.

To reuse the encoder, you can use the `Reset(io.Writer)` function to change to another output. 
This will allow the encoder to reuse all resources and avoid wasteful allocations. 

Currently stream encoding has 'light' concurrency, meaning up to 2 goroutines can be working on part 
of a stream. This is independent of the `WithEncoderConcurrency(n)`, but that is likely to change 
in the future. So if you want to limit concurrency for future updates, specify the concurrency
you would like.

You can specify your desired compression level using `WithEncoderLevel()` option. Currently only pre-defined 
compression settings can be specified.

#### Future Compatibility Guarantees

This will be an evolving project. When using this package it is important to note that both the compression efficiency and speed may change.

The goal will be to keep the default efficiency at the default zstd (level 3). 
However the encoding should never be assumed to remain the same, 
and you should not use hashes of compressed output for similarity checks.

The Encoder can be assumed to produce the same output from the exact same code version.
However, the may be modes in the future that break this, 
although they will not be enabled without an explicit option.   

This encoder is not designed to (and will probably never) output the exact same bitstream as the reference encoder.

Also note, that the cgo decompressor currently does not [report all errors on invalid input](https://github.com/DataDog/zstd/issues/59),
[omits error checks](https://github.com/DataDog/zstd/issues/61), [ignores checksums](https://github.com/DataDog/zstd/issues/43) 
and seems to ignore concatenated streams, even though [it is part of the spec](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/blob/dev/doc/zstd_compression_format.md#frames).

#### Blocks

For compressing small blocks, the returned encoder has a function called `EncodeAll(src, dst []byte) []byte`.

`EncodeAll` will encode all input in src and append it to dst.
This function can be called concurrently, but each call will only run on a single goroutine.

Encoded blocks can be concatenated and the result will be the combined input stream.
Data compressed with EncodeAll can be decoded with the Decoder, using either a stream or `DecodeAll`.

Especially when encoding blocks you should take special care to reuse the encoder. 
This will effectively make it run without allocations after a warmup period. 
To make it run completely without allocations, supply a destination buffer with space for all content.   

```Go
import "github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd"

// Create a writer that caches compressors.
// For this operation type we supply a nil Reader.
var encoder, _ = zstd.NewWriter(nil)

// Compress a buffer. 
// If you have a destination buffer, the allocation in the call can also be eliminated.
func Compress(src []byte) []byte {
    return encoder.EncodeAll(src, make([]byte, 0, len(src)))
} 
```

You can control the maximum number of concurrent encodes using the `WithEncoderConcurrency(n)` 
option when creating the writer.

Using the Encoder for both a stream and individual blocks concurrently is safe. 

### Performance

I have collected some speed examples to compare speed and compression against other compressors.

* `file` is the input file.
* `out` is the compressor used. `zskp` is this package. `zstd` is the Datadog cgo library. `gzstd/gzkp` is gzip standard and this library.
* `level` is the compression level used. For `zskp` level 1 is "fastest", level 2 is "default"; 3 is "better", 4 is "best".
* `insize`/`outsize` is the input/output size.
* `millis` is the number of milliseconds used for compression.
* `mb/s` is megabytes (2^20 bytes) per second.

## Decompressor

Staus: STABLE - there may still be subtle bugs, but a wide variety of content has been tested.

This library is being continuously [fuzz-tested](https://github.com/klauspost/compress-fuzz),
kindly supplied by [fuzzit.dev](https://fuzzit.dev/). 
The main purpose of the fuzz testing is to ensure that it is not possible to crash the decoder, 
or run it past its limits with ANY input provided.  
 
### Usage

The package has been designed for two main usages, big streams of data and smaller in-memory buffers. 
There are two main usages of the package for these. Both of them are accessed by creating a `Decoder`.

For streaming use a simple setup could look like this:

```Go
import "github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd"

func Decompress(in io.Reader, out io.Writer) error {
    d, err := zstd.NewReader(in)
    if err != nil {
        return err
    }
    defer d.Close()
    
    // Copy content...
    _, err = io.Copy(out, d)
    return err
}
```

It is important to use the "Close" function when you no longer need the Reader to stop running goroutines. 
See "Allocation-less operation" below.

For decoding buffers, it could look something like this:

```Go
import "github.com/klauspost/compress/zstd"

// Create a reader that caches decompressors.
// For this operation type we supply a nil Reader.
var decoder, _ = zstd.NewReader(nil)

// Decompress a buffer. We don't supply a destination buffer,
// so it will be allocated by the decoder.
func Decompress(src []byte) ([]byte, error) {
    return decoder.DecodeAll(src, nil)
} 
```

Both of these cases should provide the functionality needed. 
The decoder can be used for *concurrent* decompression of multiple buffers. 
It will only allow a certain number of concurrent operations to run. 
To tweak that yourself use the `WithDecoderConcurrency(n)` option when creating the decoder.   

### Dictionaries

Data compressed with [dictionaries](https://github.com/facebook/zstd#the-case-for-small-data-compression) can be decompressed.

Dictionaries are added individually to Decoders.
Dictionaries are generated by the `zstd --train` command and contains an initial state for the decoder.
To add a dictionary use the `WithDecoderDicts(dicts ...[]byte)` option with the dictionary data.
Several dictionaries can be added at once.

The dictionary will be used automatically for the data that specifies them.
A re-used Decoder will still contain the dictionaries registered.

When registering multiple dictionaries with the same ID, the last one will be used.

It is possible to use dictionaries when compressing data.

To enable a dictionary use `WithEncoderDict(dict []byte)`. Here only one dictionary will be used 
and it will likely be used even if it doesn't improve compression. 

The used dictionary must be used to decompress the content.

For any real gains, the dictionary should be built with similar data. 
If an unsuitable dictionary is used the output may be slightly larger than using no dictionary.
Use the [zstd commandline tool](https://github.com/facebook/zstd/releases) to build a dictionary from sample data.
For information see [zstd dictionary information](https://github.com/facebook/zstd#the-case-for-small-data-compression). 

For now there is a fixed startup performance penalty for compressing content with dictionaries. 
This will likely be improved over time. Just be aware to test performance when implementing.  

### Allocation-less operation

The decoder has been designed to operate without allocations after a warmup. 

This means that you should *store* the decoder for best performance. 
To re-use a stream decoder, use the `Reset(r io.Reader) error` to switch to another stream.
A decoder can safely be re-used even if the previous stream failed.

To release the resources, you must call the `Close()` function on a decoder.
After this it can *no longer be reused*, but all running goroutines will be stopped.
So you *must* use this if you will no longer need the Reader.

For decompressing smaller buffers a single decoder can be used.
When decoding buffers, you can supply a destination slice with length 0 and your expected capacity.
In this case no unneeded allocations should be made. 

### Concurrency

The buffer decoder does everything on the same goroutine and does nothing concurrently.
It can however decode several buffers concurrently. Use `WithDecoderConcurrency(n)` to limit that.

The stream decoder operates on

* One goroutine reads input and splits the input to several block decoders.
* A number of decoders will decode blocks.
* A goroutine coordinates these blocks and sends history from one to the next.

So effectively this also means the decoder will "read ahead" and prepare data to always be available for output.

Since "blocks" are quite dependent on the output of the previous block stream decoding will only have limited concurrency.

In practice this means that concurrency is often limited to utilizing about 2 cores effectively.
 
 
### Benchmarks

These are some examples of performance compared to [datadog cgo library](https://github.com/DataDog/zstd).

The first two are streaming decodes and the last are smaller inputs.
