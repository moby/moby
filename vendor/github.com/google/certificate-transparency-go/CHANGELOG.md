## v1.0.18 - Adding Migration Tool / Client Additions / K8 Config

Published 2018-06-01 14:28:20 +0000 UTC

Work on a log migration tool (Migrillian) is in progress. This is not yet ready for production use but will provide features for mirroring and migrating logs.

The `RequestLog` API allows for logging of SCTs when they are issued by CTFE.

The CT Go client now supports `GetEntryAndProof`. Utilities have been switched over to use the `glog` package.

## v1.0.17 - Merkle verification / Tracing / Demo script / CORS

Published 2018-06-01 14:25:16 +0000 UTC

Now uses Merkle Tree verification from Trillian.

The CT server now supports CORS.

Request tracing added using OpenCensus. For GCE / K8 it just requires the flag to be enabled to export traces to Stackdriver. Other environments may differ.

A demo script was added that goes through setting up a simple deployment suitable for development / demo purposes. This may be useful for those new to the project.

Facilities were added to the `x509` package to control whether verification checks are applied.

Log server requests are now balanced using `gRPClb`. 

For Kubernetes, metrics can be published to Stackdriver monitoring.

## v1.0.14 - SQLite Removed, LeafHashForLeaf

Published 2018-06-01 14:15:37 +0000 UTC

Support for SQLlite was removed. This motivation was ongoing test flakiness caused by multi-user access. This database may work for an embedded scenario but is not suitable for use in a server environment.

A `LeafHashForLeaf` client API was added and is now used by the CT client and integration tests.

## v1.0.7 - CTFE fixes

Published 2018-06-01 14:06:13 +0000 UTC

An issue was fixed with CTFE signature caching. In an unlikely set of circumstances this could lead to log mis-operation. While the chances of this are small, we recommend that versions prior to this one are not deployed.
