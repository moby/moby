## Maintenance and support for SDK major versions

For information about maintenance and support for SDK major versions and their underlying dependencies, see the
following in the AWS SDKs and Tools Shared Configuration and Credentials Reference Guide:

* [AWS SDKs and Tools Maintenance Policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/maint-policy.html)
* [AWS SDKs and Tools Version Support Matrix](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/credref/latest/refdocs/version-support-matrix.html)

## Getting started
To get started working with the SDK setup your project for Go modules, and retrieve the SDK dependencies with `go get`.
This example shows how you can use the v2 SDK to make an API request using the SDK's [Amazon DynamoDB] client.

###### Initialize Project
```sh
$ mkdir ~/helloaws
$ cd ~/helloaws
$ go mod init helloaws
```
###### Add SDK Dependencies
```sh
$ go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws
$ go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config
$ go get github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/dynamodb
```

###### Write Code
In your preferred editor add the following content to `main.go`

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "fmt"
    "log"

    "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/aws"
    "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/config"
    "github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/dynamodb"
)

func main() {
    // Using the SDK's default configuration, loading additional config
    // and credentials values from the environment variables, shared
    // credentials, and shared configuration files
    cfg, err := config.LoadDefaultConfig(context.TODO(), config.WithRegion("us-west-2"))
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("unable to load SDK config, %v", err)
    }

    // Using the Config value, create the DynamoDB client
    svc := dynamodb.NewFromConfig(cfg)

    // Build the request with its input parameters
    resp, err := svc.ListTables(context.TODO(), &dynamodb.ListTablesInput{
        Limit: aws.Int32(5),
    })
    if err != nil {
        log.Fatalf("failed to list tables, %v", err)
    }

    fmt.Println("Tables:")
    for _, tableName := range resp.TableNames {
        fmt.Println(tableName)
    }
}
```

###### Compile and Execute
```sh
$ go run .
Tables:
tableOne
tableTwo
```

## Feedback and contributing

The v2 SDK will use GitHub [Issues] to track feature requests and issues with the SDK. In addition, we'll use GitHub [Projects] to track large tasks spanning multiple pull requests, such as refactoring the SDK's internal request lifecycle. You can provide feedback to us in several ways.

**GitHub issues**. To provide feedback or report bugs, file GitHub [Issues] on the SDK. This is the preferred mechanism to give feedback so that other users can engage in the conversation, +1 issues, etc. Issues you open will be evaluated, and included in our roadmap for the GA launch.

**Contributing**. You can open pull requests for fixes or additions to the AWS SDK for Go 2.0. All pull requests must be submitted under the Apache 2.0 license and will be reviewed by an SDK team member before being merged in. Accompanying unit tests, where possible, are appreciated.
