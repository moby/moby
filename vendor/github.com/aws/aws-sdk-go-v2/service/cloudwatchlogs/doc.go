// Package cloudwatchlogs provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
//
// You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files
// from EC2 instances, CloudTrail, and other sources. You can then retrieve the
// associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the CloudWatch console.
// Alternatively, you can use CloudWatch Logs commands in the Amazon Web Services
// CLI, CloudWatch Logs API, or CloudWatch Logs SDK. You can use CloudWatch Logs
// to:
//   - Monitor logs from EC2 instances in real time: You can use CloudWatch Logs
//     to monitor applications and systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs
//     can track the number of errors that occur in your application logs. Then, it can
//     send you a notification whenever the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that you
//     specify. CloudWatch Logs uses your log data for monitoring so no code changes
//     are required. For example, you can monitor application logs for specific literal
//     terms (such as "NullReferenceException"). You can also count the number of
//     occurrences of a literal term at a particular position in log data (such as
//     "404" status codes in an Apache access log). When the term you are searching for
//     is found, CloudWatch Logs reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you
//     specify.
//   - Monitor CloudTrail logged events: You can create alarms in CloudWatch and
//     receive notifications of particular API activity as captured by CloudTrail. You
//     can use the notification to perform troubleshooting.
//   - Archive log data: You can use CloudWatch Logs to store your log data in
//     highly durable storage. You can change the log retention setting so that any log
//     events earlier than this setting are automatically deleted. The CloudWatch Logs
//     agent helps to quickly send both rotated and non-rotated log data off of a host
//     and into the log service. You can then access the raw log data when you need it.
