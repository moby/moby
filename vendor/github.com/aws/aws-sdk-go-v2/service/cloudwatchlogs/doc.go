// Package cloudwatchlogs provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
//
// You can use Amazon CloudWatch Logs to monitor, store, and access your log files
// from EC2 instances, CloudTrail, and other sources. You can then retrieve the
// associated log data from CloudWatch Logs using the CloudWatch console,
// CloudWatch Logs commands in the Amazon Web Services CLI, CloudWatch Logs API, or
// CloudWatch Logs SDK. You can use CloudWatch Logs to:
//
// * Monitor logs from EC2
// instances in real-time: You can use CloudWatch Logs to monitor applications and
// systems using log data. For example, CloudWatch Logs can track the number of
// errors that occur in your application logs and send you a notification whenever
// the rate of errors exceeds a threshold that you specify. CloudWatch Logs uses
// your log data for monitoring so no code changes are required. For example, you
// can monitor application logs for specific literal terms (such as
// "NullReferenceException") or count the number of occurrences of a literal term
// at a particular position in log data (such as "404" status codes in an Apache
// access log). When the term you are searching for is found, CloudWatch Logs
// reports the data to a CloudWatch metric that you specify.
//
// * Monitor CloudTrail
// logged events: You can create alarms in CloudWatch and receive notifications of
// particular API activity as captured by CloudTrail. You can use the notification
// to perform troubleshooting.
//
// * Archive log data: You can use CloudWatch Logs to
// store your log data in highly durable storage. You can change the log retention
// setting so that any log events older than this setting are automatically
// deleted. The CloudWatch Logs agent makes it easy to quickly send both rotated
// and non-rotated log data off of a host and into the log service. You can then
// access the raw log data when you need it.
