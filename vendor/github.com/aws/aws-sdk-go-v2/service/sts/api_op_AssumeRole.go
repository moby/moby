// Returns a set of temporary security credentials that you can use to access
// Amazon Web Services resources. These temporary credentials consist of an access
// key ID, a secret access key, and a security token. Typically, you use AssumeRole
// within your account or for cross-account access. For a comparison of AssumeRole
// with other API operations that produce temporary credentials, see [Requesting Temporary Security Credentials]and [Compare STS credentials] in the
// IAM User Guide.
//
// # Permissions
//
// The temporary security credentials created by AssumeRole can be used to make
// API calls to any Amazon Web Services service with the following exception: You
// cannot call the Amazon Web Services STS GetFederationToken or GetSessionToken
// API operations.
//
// (Optional) You can pass inline or managed session policies to this operation.
// You can pass a single JSON policy document to use as an inline session policy.
// You can also specify up to 10 managed policy Amazon Resource Names (ARNs) to use
// as managed session policies. The plaintext that you use for both inline and
// managed session policies can't exceed 2,048 characters. Passing policies to this
// operation returns new temporary credentials. The resulting session's permissions
// are the intersection of the role's identity-based policy and the session
// policies. You can use the role's temporary credentials in subsequent Amazon Web
// Services API calls to access resources in the account that owns the role. You
// cannot use session policies to grant more permissions than those allowed by the
// identity-based policy of the role that is being assumed. For more information,
// see [Session Policies]in the IAM User Guide.
//
// When you create a role, you create two policies: a role trust policy that
// specifies who can assume the role, and a permissions policy that specifies what
// can be done with the role. You specify the trusted principal that is allowed to
// assume the role in the role trust policy.
//
// To assume a role from a different account, your Amazon Web Services account
// must be trusted by the role. The trust relationship is defined in the role's
// trust policy when the role is created. That trust policy states which accounts
// are allowed to delegate that access to users in the account.
//
// A user who wants to access a role in a different account must also have
// permissions that are delegated from the account administrator. The administrator
// must attach a policy that allows the user to call AssumeRole for the ARN of the
// role in the other account.
//
// To allow a user to assume a role in the same account, you can do either of the
// following:
//
//   - Attach a policy to the user that allows the user to call AssumeRole (as long
//     as the role's trust policy trusts the account).
//
//   - Add the user as a principal directly in the role's trust policy.
//
// You can do either because the role’s trust policy acts as an IAM resource-based
// policy. When a resource-based policy grants access to a principal in the same
// account, no additional identity-based policy is required. For more information
// about trust policies and resource-based policies, see [IAM Policies]in the IAM User Guide.
//
// # Tags
//
// (Optional) You can pass tag key-value pairs to your session. These tags are
// called session tags. For more information about session tags, see [Passing Session Tags in STS]in the IAM
// User Guide.
//
// An administrator must grant you the permissions necessary to pass session tags.
// The administrator can also create granular permissions to allow you to pass only
// specific session tags. For more information, see [Tutorial: Using Tags for Attribute-Based Access Control]in the IAM User Guide.
//
// You can set the session tags as transitive. Transitive tags persist during role
// chaining. For more information, see [Chaining Roles with Session Tags]in the IAM User Guide.
//
// # Using MFA with AssumeRole
//
// (Optional) You can include multi-factor authentication (MFA) information when
// you call AssumeRole . This is useful for cross-account scenarios to ensure that
// the user that assumes the role has been authenticated with an Amazon Web
// Services MFA device. In that scenario, the trust policy of the role being
// assumed includes a condition that tests for MFA authentication. If the caller
// does not include valid MFA information, the request to assume the role is
// denied. The condition in a trust policy that tests for MFA authentication might
// look like the following example.
//
//	"Condition": {"Bool": {"aws:MultiFactorAuthPresent": true}}
//
// For more information, see [Configuring MFA-Protected API Access] in the IAM User Guide guide.
//
// To use MFA with AssumeRole , you pass values for the SerialNumber and TokenCode
// parameters. The SerialNumber value identifies the user's hardware or virtual
// MFA device. The TokenCode is the time-based one-time password (TOTP) that the
// MFA device produces.

	// The duration, in seconds, of the role session. The value specified can range

	// Role chaining limits your Amazon Web Services CLI or Amazon Web Services API
