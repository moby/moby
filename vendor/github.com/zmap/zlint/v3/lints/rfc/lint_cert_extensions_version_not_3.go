/************************************************
4.1.2.1.  Version
   This field describes the version of the encoded certificate. When
   extensions are used, as expected in this profile, version MUST be 3
   (value is 2). If no extensions are present, but a UniqueIdentifier
   is present, the version SHOULD be 2 (value is 1); however, the version
   MAY be 3.  If only basic fields are present, the version SHOULD be 1
   (the value is omitted from the certificate as the default value);
   however, the version MAY be 2 or 3.

   Implementations SHOULD be prepared to accept any version certificate.
   At a minimum, conforming implementations MUST recognize version 3 certificates.
4.1.2.9.  Extensions
   This field MUST only appear if the version is 3 (Section 4.1.2.1).
   If present, this field is a SEQUENCE of one or more certificate
   extensions. The format and content of certificate extensions in the
   Internet PKI are defined in Section 4.2.
