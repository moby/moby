/************************************************************************
RFC 5280: 4.2.1.6
 When the issuerAltName extension contains an Internet mail address,
   the address MUST be stored in the rfc822Name.  The format of an
   rfc822Name is a "Mailbox" as defined in Section 4.1.2 of [RFC2821].
   A Mailbox has the form "Local-part@Domain".  Note that a Mailbox has
   no phrase (such as a common name) before it, has no comment (text
   surrounded in parentheses) after it, and is not surrounded by "<" and
   ">".  Rules for encoding Internet mail addresses that include
   internationalized domain names are specified in Section 7.5.
