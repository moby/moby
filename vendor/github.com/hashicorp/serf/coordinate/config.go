	// we chose 8 dimensions plus a non-Euclidean height.

	// VivaldiErrorMax is the default error value when a node hasn't yet made
	// any observations. It also serves as an upper limit on the error value in
	// case observations cause the error value to increase without bound.
	VivaldiErrorMax float64

	// VivaldiCE is a tuning factor that controls the maximum impact an
	// observation can have on a node's confidence. See [1] for more details.
	VivaldiCE float64

	// VivaldiCC is a tuning factor that controls the maximum impact an
	// observation can have on a node's coordinate. See [1] for more details.
	VivaldiCC float64

	// AdjustmentWindowSize is a tuning factor that determines how many samples
	// we retain to calculate the adjustment factor as discussed in [3]. Setting
	// this to zero disables this feature.
	AdjustmentWindowSize uint

	// HeightMin is the minimum value of the height parameter. Since this
	// always must be positive, it will introduce a small amount error, so
	// the chosen value should be relatively small compared to "normal"
	// coordinates.
	HeightMin float64

	// LatencyFilterSamples is the maximum number of samples that are retained
	// per node, in order to compute a median. The intent is to ride out blips
	// but still keep the delay low, since our time to probe any given node is
	// pretty infrequent. See [2] for more details.

	// to try to re-center coordinates. See [2] for more details.
