# Contributing

We would love to have people submit pull requests and help make `grpc-ecosystem/go-grpc-middleware` even better 👍.

Fork, then clone the repo:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:your-username/go-grpc-middleware.git
```    

Before checking in please run the following:

```bash
make all
```

This will `vet`, `fmt`, regenerate documentation and run all tests.


Push to your fork and open a pull request.
