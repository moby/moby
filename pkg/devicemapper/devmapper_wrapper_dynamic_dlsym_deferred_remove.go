// dm_info with deferred_remove we need to have a struct definition that is
// correct (regardless of the version of libdm that was used to compile it). To
// this end, we define struct_backport_dm_info. This code comes from lvm2, and
// I have verified that the structure has only ever had elements *appended* to
// it (since 2001).
//
// It is also important that this structure be _larger_ than the dm_info that
// libdevmapper expected. Otherwise libdm might try to write to memory it
// shouldn't (they don't have a "known size" API).
