# Get Started with Docker

This tutorial is a for non-technical users who are interested in learning more about Docker. By following these steps, you'll learn fundamental Docker features while working through some simple tasks.

Depending on how you got here, you may or may not have already downloaded Docker for your platform and installed it.

## Got Docker?

If you haven't yet downloaded Docker for your platform or installed it, go to [Get Docker](step_one.md#step-1-get-docker).

## Ready to start working with Docker?

If you have already downloaded and installed Docker, you are ready to run Docker commands! Go to [Verify your installation](step_one.md#step-3-verify-your-installation).


### What you'll learn and do

You'll learn how to:

* install Docker software for your platform
* run a software image in a container
* browse for an image on Docker Hub
* create your own image and run it in a container
* create a Docker Hub account and an image repository
* create an image of your own
* push your image to Docker Hub for others to use

The getting started was user tested to reduce the chance of users having problems. For the best chance of success, follow the steps as written the first time before exploring on your own. It takes approximately 45 minutes to complete.

## Flavors of Docker

This tutorial is designed as a getting started with Docker, and works the same whether you are using Docker for Mac, Docker for Windows, Docker on Linux, or Docker Toolbox (for older Mac and Windows systems).

If you are using Docker Toolbox, you can use the Docker Quickstart Terminal to run Docker commands in a pre-configured environment instead of opening a command line terminal.

If you are using Docker for Mac, Docker for Windows, or Docker on Linux, you will have Docker running in the background, and your standard command line terminal is already set up to run Docker commands.

## How much command line savvy do I need?

The getting started tour uses Docker Engine CLI commands entered on the command line of a terminal window. You don't need to be a wizard at the command line, but you should be familiar with how to open your favorite shell or terminal, and run basic commands in that environment. It helps (but isn't required) to know how to navigate a directory tree, manipulate files, list running process, and so forth.
