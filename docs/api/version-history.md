## v1.41 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.41](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.41/) documentation

* `GET /events` now returns `prune` events after pruning resources have completed.
  Prune events are returned for `container`, `network`, `volume`, `image`, and
  `builder`, and have a `reclaimed` attribute, indicating the amount of space
  reclaimed (in bytes).
* `GET /info` now returns a `CgroupVersion` field, containing the cgroup version.
* `GET /info` now returns a `DefaultAddressPools` field, containing a list of
  custom default address pools for local networks, which can be specified in the
  `daemon.json` file or `--default-address-pool` dockerd option.
* `POST /services/create` and `POST /services/{id}/update` now supports `BindOptions.NonRecursive`.
* The `ClusterStore` and `ClusterAdvertise` fields in `GET /info` are deprecated
  and are now omitted if they contain an empty value. This change is not versioned,
  and affects all API versions if the daemon has this patch.
* The `filter` (singular) query parameter, which was deprecated in favor of the
  `filters` option in Docker 1.13, has now been removed from the `GET /images/json`
  endpoint. The parameter remains available when using API version 1.40 or below.
* `GET /services` now returns `CapAdd` and `CapDrop` as part of the `ContainerSpec`.
* `GET /services/{id}` now returns `CapAdd` and `CapDrop` as part of the `ContainerSpec`.

  to limit the maximum number of PIDs.
* `GET /tasks` now  returns `Pids` in `TaskTemplate.Resources.Limits`.
* `GET /tasks/{id}` now  returns `Pids` in `TaskTemplate.Resources.Limits`.
* `POST /containers/create` on Linux now accepts the `HostConfig.CgroupnsMode` property.
  Set the property to `host` to create the container in the daemon's cgroup namespace, or
  `private` to create the container in its own private cgroup namespace.  The per-daemon
  default is `host`, and can be changed by using the`CgroupNamespaceMode` daemon configuration
  parameter.
* `GET /info` now  returns an `OSVersion` field, containing the operating system's
  version. This change is not versioned, and affects all API versions if the daemon
  has this patch.
* `GET /info` no longer returns the `SystemStatus` field if it does not have a
  value set. This change is not versioned, and affects all API versions if the
  daemon has this patch.

  services returned will include `ServiceStatus`, which provides Desired,
  Running, and Completed task counts for the service.

  service.
* `GET /tasks/{id}` now includes `JobIteration` on the task if spawned from a
  job-mode service.
* `GET /containers/{id}/stats` now accepts a query param (`one-shot`) which, when used with `stream=false` fetches a
  single set of stats instead of waiting for two collection cycles to have 2 CPU stats over a 1 second period.
* The `KernelMemory` field in `HostConfig.Resources` is now deprecated.
* The `KernelMemory` field in `Info` is now deprecated.
* `GET /services` now returns `Ulimits` as part of `ContainerSpec`.

* The `/_ping` endpoint can now be accessed both using `GET` or `HEAD` requests.
  when accessed using a `HEAD` request, all headers are returned, but the body
  is empty (`Content-Length: 0`). This change is not versioned, and affects all
  API versions if the daemon has this patch. Clients are recommended to try
  using `HEAD`, but fallback to `GET` if the `HEAD` requests fails.
* `GET /_ping` and `HEAD /_ping` now set `Cache-Control` and `Pragma` headers to
  prevent the result from being cached. This change is not versioned, and affects
  all API versions if the daemon has this patch.
* `GET /services` now returns `Sysctls` as part of the `ContainerSpec`.
* `GET /services/{id}` now returns `Sysctls` as part of the `ContainerSpec`.
* `POST /services/create` now accepts `Sysctls` as part of the `ContainerSpec`.
* `POST /services/{id}/update` now accepts `Sysctls` as part of the `ContainerSpec`.

* `GET /tasks/{id}` now  returns `Sysctls` as part of the `ContainerSpec`.
* `GET /networks` now supports a `dangling` filter type. When set to `true` (or
  `1`), the endpoint returns all networks that are not in use by a container. When
  set to `false` (or `0`), only networks that are in use by one or more containers
  are returned.
* `GET /nodes` now supports a filter type `node.label` filter to filter nodes based
  on the node.label. The format of the label filter is `node.label=<key>`/`node.label=<key>=<value>`
  to return those with the specified labels, or `node.label!=<key>`/`node.label!=<key>=<value>`
  to return those without the specified labels.
* `POST /containers/create` now accepts a `fluentd-async` option in `HostConfig.LogConfig.Config`
  when using the Fluentd logging driver. This option deprecates the `fluentd-async-connect`
  option, which remains funtional, but will be removed in a future release. Users
  are encouraged to use the `fluentd-async` option going forward. This change is
  not versioned, and affects all API versions if the daemon has this patch.
* `POST /containers/create` now accepts a `fluentd-request-ack` option in
  `HostConfig.LogConfig.Config` when using the Fluentd logging driver. If enabled,
  the Fluentd logging driver sends the chunk option with a unique ID. The server
  will respond with an acknowledgement. This option improves the reliability of
  the message transmission. This change is not versioned, and affects all API
  versions if the daemon has this patch.
* `POST /containers/create`, `GET /containers/{id}/json`, and `GET /containers/json` now supports
  `BindOptions.NonRecursive`.

  rootless mode.  This change is not versioned, and affects all API versions if the daemon has
  this patch.
* `GET /info` now returns `none` as `CgroupDriver` when the daemon is running in rootless mode.
  This change is not versioned, and affects all API versions if the daemon has this patch.

  as part of the service `Placement`, allowing to specify maximum replicas per node for the service.
* `POST /containers/create` on Linux now creates a container with `HostConfig.IpcMode=private`
  by default, if IpcMode is not explicitly specified. The per-daemon default can be changed
  back to `shareable` by using `DefaultIpcMode` daemon configuration parameter.
* `POST /containers/{id}/update` now accepts a `PidsLimit` field to tune a container's
  PID limit. Set `0` or `-1` for unlimited. Leave `null` to not change the current value.
* `POST /build` now accepts `outputs` key for configuring build outputs when using BuildKit mode.

## V1.39 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.39](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.39/) documentation

  network's name was able to mask that `id`. If both a network with the given
  _name_ exists, and a network with the given _id_, the network with the given
  _id_ is now deleted. This change is not versioned, and affects all API versions
  if the daemon has this patch.

  if the default (internal) secrets store is used.
* `GET /secrets/(id)` and `GET /secrets` now return a `Driver` struct,
  containing the `Name` and driver-specific `Options` of the external
  secrets store used to store the secret. The `Driver` property is
