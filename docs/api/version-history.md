## v1.42 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.42](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.42/) documentation

* Removed the `BuilderSize` field on the `GET /system/df` endpoint. This field
  was introduced in API 1.31 as part of an experimental feature, and no longer
  used since API 1.40.
  Use field `BuildCache` instead to track storage used by the builder component.
* `POST /containers/{id}/stop` and `POST /containers/{id}/restart` now accept a
  `signal` query parameter, which allows overriding the container's default stop-
  signal.
* `GET /images/json` now accepts query parameter `shared-size`. When set `true`,
  images returned will include `SharedSize`, which provides the size on disk shared
  with other images present on the system.
* `GET /system/df` now accepts query parameter `type`. When set,
  computes and returns data only for the specified object type.
  The parameter can be specified multiple times to select several object types.
  Supported values are: `container`, `image`, `volume`, `build-cache`.
* `GET /system/df` can now be used concurrently. If a request is made while a
  previous request is still being processed, the request will receive the result
  of the already running calculation, once completed. Previously, an error
  (`a disk usage operation is already running`) would be returned in this
  situation. This change is not versioned, and affects all API versions if the
  daemon has this patch.
* The `POST /images/create` now supports both the operating system and architecture
  that is passed through the `platform` query parameter when using the `fromSrc`
  option to import an image from an archive. Previously, only the operating system
  was used and the architecture was ignored. If no `platform` option is set, the
  host's operating system and architecture as used as default. This change is not
  versioned, and affects all API versions if the daemon has this patch.
* The `POST /containers/{id}/wait` endpoint now returns a `400` status code if an
  invalid `condition` is provided (on API 1.30 and up).
* Removed the `KernelMemory` field from the `POST /containers/create` and
  `POST /containers/{id}/update` endpoints, any value it is set to will be ignored
  on API version `v1.42` and up. Older API versions still accept this field, but
  may take no effect, depending on the kernel version and OCI runtime in use.
* `GET /containers/{id}/json` now omits the `KernelMemory` and `KernelMemoryTCP`
  if they are not set.
* `GET /info` now omits the `KernelMemory` and `KernelMemoryTCP` if they are not
  supported by the host or host's configuration (if cgroups v2 are in use).
* `GET /_ping` and `HEAD /_ping` now return a `Swarm` header, which allows a
  client to detect if Swarm is enabled on the daemon, without having to call
  additional endpoints.
  This change is not versioned, and affects all API versions if the daemon has
  this patch. Clients must consider this header "optional", and fall back to
  using other endpoints to get this information if the header is not present.

  The `Swarm` header can contain one of the following values:

    - "inactive"
    - "pending"
    - "error"
    - "locked"
    - "active/worker"
    - "active/manager"
* `POST /containers/create` for Windows containers now accepts a new syntax in
  `HostConfig.Resources.Devices.PathOnHost`. As well as the existing `class/<GUID>`
  syntax, `<IDType>://<ID>` is now recognised. Support for specific `<IDType>` values
  depends on the underlying implementation and Windows version. This change is not
  versioned, and affects all API versions if the daemon has this patch.
* `GET /containers/{id}/attach`, `GET /exec/{id}/start`, `GET /containers/{id}/logs`
  `GET /services/{id}/logs` and `GET /tasks/{id}/logs` now set Content-Type header
  to `application/vnd.docker.multiplexed-stream` when a multiplexed stdout/stderr 
  stream is sent to client, `application/vnd.docker.raw-stream` otherwise.
* `POST /volumes/create` now accepts a new `ClusterVolumeSpec` to create a cluster
  volume (CNI). This option can only be used if the daemon is a Swarm manager.
  The Volume response on creation now also can contain a `ClusterVolume` field
  with information about the created volume.
* Volume information returned by `GET /volumes/{name}`, `GET /volumes` and
  `GET /system/df` can now contain a `ClusterVolume` if the volume is a cluster
  volume (requires the daemon to be a Swarm manager).
* The `Volume` type, as returned by `Added new `ClusterVolume` fields 
* Added a new `PUT /volumes{name}` endpoint to update cluster volumes (CNI).
  Cluster volumes are only supported if the daemon is a Swarm manager.

## v1.41 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.41](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.41/) documentation

* `GET /events` now returns `prune` events after pruning resources have completed.
  Prune events are returned for `container`, `network`, `volume`, `image`, and
  `builder`, and have a `reclaimed` attribute, indicating the amount of space
  reclaimed (in bytes).
* `GET /info` now returns a `CgroupVersion` field, containing the cgroup version.
* `GET /info` now returns a `DefaultAddressPools` field, containing a list of
  custom default address pools for local networks, which can be specified in the
  `daemon.json` file or `--default-address-pool` dockerd option.

  and affects all API versions if the daemon has this patch.
* The `filter` (singular) query parameter, which was deprecated in favor of the

* `GET /tasks/{id}` now  returns `Pids` in `TaskTemplate.Resources.Limits`.
* `POST /containers/create` on Linux now accepts the `HostConfig.CgroupnsMode` property.
  Set the property to `host` to create the container in the daemon's cgroup namespace, or
  `private` to create the container in its own private cgroup namespace.  The per-daemon
  default is `host`, and can be changed by using the`CgroupNamespaceMode` daemon configuration
  parameter.
* `GET /info` now  returns an `OSVersion` field, containing the operating system's
  version. This change is not versioned, and affects all API versions if the daemon
  has this patch.
* `GET /info` no longer returns the `SystemStatus` field if it does not have a
  value set. This change is not versioned, and affects all API versions if the
  daemon has this patch.
* `GET /services` now accepts query parameter `status`. When set `true`,
  services returned will include `ServiceStatus`, which provides Desired,
  Running, and Completed task counts for the service.
* `GET /services` may now include `ReplicatedJob` or `GlobalJob` as the `Mode`
  in a `ServiceSpec`.
* `GET /services/{id}` may now include `ReplicatedJob` or `GlobalJob` as the

  job-mode service.
* `GET /containers/{id}/stats` now accepts a query param (`one-shot`) which, when used with `stream=false` fetches a
  single set of stats instead of waiting for two collection cycles to have 2 CPU stats over a 1 second period.
* The `KernelMemory` field in `HostConfig.Resources` is now deprecated.
* The `KernelMemory` field in `Info` is now deprecated.
* `GET /services` now returns `Ulimits` as part of `ContainerSpec`.

## v1.40 API changes

[Docker Engine API v1.40](https://docs.docker.com/engine/api/v1.40/) documentation

* The `/_ping` endpoint can now be accessed both using `GET` or `HEAD` requests.
  when accessed using a `HEAD` request, all headers are returned, but the body
  is empty (`Content-Length: 0`). This change is not versioned, and affects all
  API versions if the daemon has this patch. Clients are recommended to try
  using `HEAD`, but fallback to `GET` if the `HEAD` requests fails.
* `GET /_ping` and `HEAD /_ping` now set `Cache-Control` and `Pragma` headers to
  prevent the result from being cached. This change is not versioned, and affects
  all API versions if the daemon has this patch.
* `GET /services` now returns `Sysctls` as part of the `ContainerSpec`.

* `GET /networks` now supports a `dangling` filter type. When set to `true` (or
  `1`), the endpoint returns all networks that are not in use by a container. When
  set to `false` (or `0`), only networks that are in use by one or more containers
  are returned.
* `GET /nodes` now supports a filter type `node.label` filter to filter nodes based
  on the node.label. The format of the label filter is `node.label=<key>`/`node.label=<key>=<value>`
  to return those with the specified labels, or `node.label!=<key>`/`node.label!=<key>=<value>`
  to return those without the specified labels.
* `POST /containers/create` now accepts a `fluentd-async` option in `HostConfig.LogConfig.Config`
  when using the Fluentd logging driver. This option deprecates the `fluentd-async-connect`
  option, which remains funtional, but will be removed in a future release. Users
  are encouraged to use the `fluentd-async` option going forward. This change is
  not versioned, and affects all API versions if the daemon has this patch.
* `POST /containers/create` now accepts a `fluentd-request-ack` option in
  `HostConfig.LogConfig.Config` when using the Fluentd logging driver. If enabled,
  the Fluentd logging driver sends the chunk option with a unique ID. The server
  will respond with an acknowledgement. This option improves the reliability of
  the message transmission. This change is not versioned, and affects all API
  versions if the daemon has this patch.
* `POST /containers/create`, `GET /containers/{id}/json`, and `GET /containers/json` now supports
  `BindOptions.NonRecursive`.

  as part of the service `Placement`, allowing to specify maximum replicas per node for the service.
* `POST /containers/create` on Linux now creates a container with `HostConfig.IpcMode=private`
  by default, if IpcMode is not explicitly specified. The per-daemon default can be changed
  back to `shareable` by using `DefaultIpcMode` daemon configuration parameter.
* `POST /containers/{id}/update` now accepts a `PidsLimit` field to tune a container's
  PID limit. Set `0` or `-1` for unlimited. Leave `null` to not change the current value.
* `POST /build` now accepts `outputs` key for configuring build outputs when using BuildKit mode.

## V1.39 API changes

  if the default (internal) secrets store is used.
* `GET /secrets/(id)` and `GET /secrets` now return a `Driver` struct,
  containing the `Name` and driver-specific `Options` of the external
  secrets store used to store the secret. The `Driver` property is
