## Using Joyent's Triton Elastic Container Service for Docker

Joyent's Triton Elastic Container Service for Docker uses the native Docker API
and allows you to securely provision containers on bare metal.  For detailed
instructions on using Joyent with Docker, see [Deploying Couchbase clusters the
easy way with Triton and
Docker](https://www.joyent.com/blog/couchbase-in-docker-containers) from Joyent.

Joyent provides a `sdc-docker-setup.sh` script that makes it easy to use Docker
with Joyent. The [Docker API guide for
Triton](https://apidocs.joyent.com/docker) has details on using this script.

Once you are up and running with Joyent, continue with the [Docker user guide](../userguide/index.md).
