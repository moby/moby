# Metrics Collector Plugins

Docker exposes internal metrics based on the prometheus format. Metrics plugins
enable accessing these metrics in a consistent way by providing a Unix
socket at a predefined path where the plugin can scrape the metrics.

> **Note**: that while the plugin interface for metrics is non-experimental, the naming
of the metrics and metric labels is still considered experimental and may change
in a future version.

## Creating a metrics plugin

You must currently set `PropagatedMount` in the plugin `config.json` to
`/run/docker`. This allows the plugin to receive updated mounts
(the bind-mounted socket) from Docker after the plugin is already configured.

## MetricsCollector protocol

Metrics plugins must register as implementing the`MetricsCollector` interface
in `config.json`.

On Unix platforms, the socket is located at `/run/docker/metrics.sock` in the
plugin's rootfs.

`MetricsCollector` must implement two endpoints:

### `MetricsCollector.StartMetrics`

Signals to the plugin that the metrics socket is now available for scraping

**Request**
```json
{}
```

The request has no playload.

**Response**
```json
{
	"Err": ""
}
```

If an error occurred during this request, add an error message to the `Err` field
in the response. If no error then you can either send an empty response (`{}`)
or an empty value for the `Err` field. Errors will only be logged.

### `MetricsCollector.StopMetrics`

Signals to the plugin that the metrics socket is no longer available.
This may happen when the daemon is shutting down.

**Request**
```json
{}
```

The request has no playload.

**Response**
```json
{
	"Err": ""
}
```

If an error occurred during this request, add an error message to the `Err` field
in the response. If no error then you can either send an empty response (`{}`)
or an empty value for the `Err` field. Errors will only be logged.
