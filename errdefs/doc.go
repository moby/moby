// Package errdefs defines a set of error interfaces that packages should use for communicating classes of errors.
// Errors that cross the package boundary should implement one (and only one) of these interfaces.
//
// Packages should not reference these interfaces directly, only implement them.
// To check if a particular error implements one of these interfaces, there are helper
// functions provided (e.g. `Is<SomeError>`) which can be used rather than asserting the interfaces directly.
// If you must assert on these interfaces, be sure to check the causal chain (`err.Cause()`).
package errdefs // import "github.com/moby/moby/errdefs"
