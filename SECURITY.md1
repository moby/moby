# Reporting security issues

The Moby maintainers take security seriously. If you discover a security issue, please bring it to their attention right away!

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please **DO NOT** file a public issue, instead send your report privately to security@docker.com.

Security reports are greatly appreciated and we will publicly thank you for it, although we keep your name confidential if you request it. We also like to send giftsâ€”if you're into schwag, make sure to let us know. We currently do not offer a paid security bounty program, but are not ruling it out in the future.
