## 17.03.0-ce (2017-03-01)

**IMPORTANT**: Starting with this release, Docker is on a monthly release cycle and uses a
new YY.MM versioning scheme to reflect this. Two channels are available: monthly and quarterly.
Any given monthly release will only receive security and bugfixes until the next monthly
release is available. Quarterly releases receive security and bugfixes for 4 months after
initial release. This release includes bugfixes for 1.13.1 but
there are no major feature additions and the API version stays the same.
Upgrading from Docker 1.13.1 to 17.03.0 is expected to be simple and low-risk.

## 1.13.1 (2017-02-08)

**IMPORTANT**: On Linux distributions where `devicemapper` was the default storage driver,
the `overlay2`, or `overlay` is now used by default (if the kernel supports it).
To use devicemapper, you can manually configure the storage driver to use through
the `--storage-driver` daemon option, or by setting "storage-driver" in the `daemon.json`
configuration file.

**IMPORTANT**: In Docker 1.13, the managed plugin api changed, as compared to the experimental
version introduced in Docker 1.12. You must **uninstall** plugins which you installed with Docker 1.12
_before_ upgrading to Docker 1.13. You can uninstall plugins using the `docker plugin rm` command.

If you have already upgraded to Docker 1.13 without uninstalling
previously-installed plugins, you may see this message when the Docker daemon
starts:

    Error starting daemon: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type types.PluginEnv

To manually remove all plugins and resolve this problem, take the following steps:

## 1.13.0 (2017-01-18)

**IMPORTANT**: On Linux distributions where `devicemapper` was the default storage driver,
the `overlay2`, or `overlay` is now used by default (if the kernel supports it).
To use devicemapper, you can manually configure the storage driver to use through
the `--storage-driver` daemon option, or by setting "storage-driver" in the `daemon.json`
configuration file.

**IMPORTANT**: In Docker 1.13, the managed plugin api changed, as compared to the experimental
version introduced in Docker 1.12. You must **uninstall** plugins which you installed with Docker 1.12
_before_ upgrading to Docker 1.13. You can uninstall plugins using the `docker plugin rm` command.

If you have already upgraded to Docker 1.13 without uninstalling
previously-installed plugins, you may see this message when the Docker daemon
starts:

    Error starting daemon: json: cannot unmarshal string into Go value of type types.PluginEnv

To manually remove all plugins and resolve this problem, take the following steps:

1. Remove plugins.json from: `/var/lib/docker/plugins/`.
2. Restart Docker. Verify that the Docker daemon starts with no errors.
3. Reinstall your plugins.

## 1.12.6 (2017-01-10)

**IMPORTANT**: Docker 1.12 ships with an updated systemd unit file for rpm
based installs (which includes RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7). When
upgrading from an older version of docker, the upgrade process may not
automatically install the updated version of the unit file, or fail to start
the docker service if;

- the systemd unit file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`) contains local changes, or
- a systemd drop-in file is present, and contains `-H fd://` in the `ExecStart` directive

Starting the docker service will produce an error:

    Failed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.

or

    no sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.

To resolve this:

- Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the
  [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)
- Remove the `Requires=docker.socket` directive from the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` file if present
- Remove `-H fd://` from the `ExecStart` directive (both in the main unit file, and in any drop-in files present).

After making those changes, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and `sudo
systemctl restart docker` to reload changes and (re)start the docker daemon.

**NOTE**: Docker 1.12.5 will correctly validate that either an IPv6 subnet is provided or
that the IPAM driver can provide one when you specify the `--ipv6` option.

If you are currently using the `--ipv6` option _without_ specifying the
`--fixed-cidr-v6` option, the Docker daemon will refuse to start with the
following message:

```none
Error starting daemon: Error initializing network controller: Error creating
                       default "bridge" network: failed to parse pool request
                       for address space "LocalDefault" pool " subpool ":
                       could not find an available, non-overlapping IPv6 address
                       pool among the defaults to assign to the network
```

To resolve this error, either remove the `--ipv6` flag (to preserve the same
behavior as in Docker 1.12.3 and earlier), or provide an IPv6 subnet as the
value of the `--fixed-cidr-v6` flag.

In a similar way, if you specify the `--ipv6` flag when creating a network
with the default IPAM driver, without providing an IPv6 `--subnet`, network
creation will fail with the following message:

```none
Error response from daemon: failed to parse pool request for address space
                            "LocalDefault" pool "" subpool "": could not find an
                            available, non-overlapping IPv6 address pool among
                            the defaults to assign to the network
```

To resolve this, either remove the `--ipv6` flag (to preserve the same behavior
as in Docker 1.12.3 and earlier), or provide an IPv6 subnet as the value of the
`--subnet` flag.

The network network creation will instead succeed if you use an external IPAM driver
which supports automatic allocation of IPv6 subnets.

Starting the docker service will produce an error:

    Failed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.

or

    no sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.

To resolve this:

- Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the
  [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)

## 1.12.0 (2016-07-28)


**IMPORTANT**: Docker 1.12.0 ships with an updated systemd unit file for rpm
based installs (which includes RHEL, Fedora, CentOS, and Oracle Linux 7). When
upgrading from an older version of docker, the upgrade process may not
automatically install the updated version of the unit file, or fail to start
the docker service if;

- the systemd unit file (`/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service`) contains local changes, or
- a systemd drop-in file is present, and contains `-H fd://` in the `ExecStart` directive

Starting the docker service will produce an error:

    Failed to start docker.service: Unit docker.socket failed to load: No such file or directory.

or

    no sockets found via socket activation: make sure the service was started by systemd.

To resolve this:

- Backup the current version of the unit file, and replace the file with the
  [version that ships with docker 1.12](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/docker/docker/v1.12.0/contrib/init/systemd/docker.service.rpm)
- Remove the `Requires=docker.socket` directive from the `/usr/lib/systemd/system/docker.service` file if present
- Remove `-H fd://` from the `ExecStart` directive (both in the main unit file, and in any drop-in files present).

After making those changes, run `sudo systemctl daemon-reload`, and `sudo
systemctl restart docker` to reload changes and (re)start the docker daemon.

**IMPORTANT**: With Docker 1.12, a Linux docker installation now has two
additional binaries; `dockerd`, and `docker-proxy`. If you have scripts for
installing docker, please make sure to update them accordingly.

+ Docker Content Trust now supports the ability to read and write user delegations [#18887](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/18887)
  This is an optional, opt-in feature that requires the explicit use of the Notary command-line utility in order to be enabled.
  Enabling delegation support in a specific repository will break the ability of Docker 1.9 and 1.8 to pull from that repository, if content trust is enabled.
* Allow SELinux to run in a container when using the BTRFS storage driver [#16452](https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/16452)

### Distribution

  Note that a migration is performed the first time docker is run; it can take a significant amount of time depending on the number of images and containers present.
  Images no longer depend on the parent chain but contain a list of layer references.
  `docker load`/`docker save` tarballs now also contain content-addressable image configurations.

## 0.8.0 (2014-02-04)

#### Notable features since 0.7.0

* Images and containers can be removed much faster
* Building an image from source with docker build is now much faster
* The Docker daemon starts and stops much faster
* The memory footprint of many common operations has been reduced, by streaming files instead of buffering them in memory, fixing memory leaks, and fixing various suboptimal memory allocations
* Several race conditions were fixed, making Docker more stable under very high concurrency load. This makes Docker more stable and less likely to crash and reduces the memory footprint of many common operations
* All packaging operations are now built on the Go language’s standard tar implementation, which is bundled with Docker itself. This makes packaging more portable across host distributions, and solves several issues caused by quirks and incompatibilities between different distributions of tar
* Docker can now create, remove and modify larger numbers of containers and images graciously thanks to more aggressive releasing of system resources. For example the storage driver API now allows Docker to do reference counting on mounts created by the drivers
With the ongoing changes to the networking and execution subsystems of docker testing these areas have been a focus of the refactoring.  By moving these subsystems into separate packages we can test, analyze, and monitor coverage and quality of these packages
* Many components have been separated into smaller sub-packages, each with a dedicated test suite. As a result the code is better-tested, more readable and easier to change

* The ADD instruction now supports caching, which avoids unnecessarily re-uploading the same source content again and again when it hasn’t changed
* The new ONBUILD instruction adds to your image a “trigger” instruction to be executed at a later time, when the image is used as the base for another build
* Docker now ships with an experimental storage driver which uses the BTRFS filesystem for copy-on-write
* Docker is officially supported on Mac OS X
* The Docker daemon supports systemd socket activation
