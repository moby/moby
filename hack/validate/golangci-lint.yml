    # We prefer to use an "exclude-list" so that new "default" exclusions are not
    # automatically inherited. We can decide whether or not to follow upstream
    # defaults when updating golang-ci-lint versions.
    # Unfortunately, this means we have to copy the whole exclusion pattern, as
    # (unlike the "include" option), the "exclude" option does not take exclusion
    # ID's.

    # These exclusion patterns are copied from the default excluses at:
