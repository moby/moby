# CONTAINERD_VERSION specifies the version of the containerd runtime binary
# to install from the https://github.com/containerd/containerd repository.
#
# This version is used to build statically compiled containerd binaries, and
# used for the integration tests. The distributed docker .deb and .rpm packages
# depend on a separate (containerd.io) package, which may be a different version
# as is specified here.
#
# Generally, the commit specified here should match a tagged release.
#
# The containerd golang package is also pinned in vendor.mod. When updating
# the binary version you may also need to update the vendor version to pick up
# bug fixes or new APIs, however, usually the Go packages are built from a
# commit from the master branch.
