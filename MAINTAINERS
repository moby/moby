	[Org."Core maintainers"]

	# The Core maintainers are the ghostbusters of the project: when there's a problem others
	# can't solve, they show up and fix it with bizarre devices and weaponry.
	# They have final say on technical implementation and coding style.
	# They are ultimately responsible for quality in all its forms: usability polish,
	# bugfixes, performance, stability, etc. When ownership  can cleanly be passed to
	# a subsystem, they are responsible for doing so and holding the
	# subsystem maintainers accountable. If ownership is unclear, they are the de facto owners.

	# The curators help ensure that incoming issues and pull requests are properly triaged and

	# the repository activity, they can also guide contributors to relevant material or
	# discussions.
	#
	# They are neither code nor docs reviewers, so they are never expected to merge. They can
	# however:
	# - close an issue or pull request when it's an exact duplicate
	# - close an issue or pull request when it's inappropriate or off-topic

			# Aaron Lehmann was a maintainer for swarmkit, the registry, and the engine,
			# and contributed many improvements, features, and bugfixes in those areas,
			# among which "automated service rollbacks", templated secrets and configs,
			# and resumable image layer downloads.
			"aaronlehmann",

			# Harald Albers is the mastermind behind the bash completion scripts for the
			# Docker CLI. The completion scripts moved to the Docker CLI repository, so
			# you can now find him perform his magic in the https://github.com/docker/cli repository.
			"albers",

			# Andrea Luzzardi started contributing to the Docker codebase in the "dotCloud"
			# era, even before it was called "Docker". They is one of the architects of both
			# Swarm and SwarmKit, and its integration into the Docker engine.
			"aluzzardi",
			
			# David Calavera contributed many features to Docker, such as an improved
			# event system, dynamic configuration reloading, volume plugins, fancy
			# new templating options, and an external client credential store. As a
			# maintainer, David was release captain for Docker 1.8, and competing
			# with Jess Frazelle to be "top dream killer".
			# David is now doing amazing stuff as CTO for https://www.netlify.com,
			# and tweets as @calavera.
			"calavera",

			# Michael Crosby was "chief maintainer" of the Docker project.
			# During their time as a maintainer, Michael contributed to many
			# milestones of the project; they was release captain of Docker v1.0.0,
			# started the development of "libcontainer" (what later became runc)
			# and containerd, as well as demoing cool hacks such as live migrating
			# a game server container with checkpoint/restore.
			#
			# Michael is currently a maintainer of containerd, but you may see
			# them around in other projects on GitHub.
			"crosbymichael",

			# Before becoming a maintainer, Daniel Nephin was a core contributor
			# to "Fig" (now known as Docker Compose). As a maintainer for both the
			# Engine and Docker CLI, Daniel contributed many features, among which
			# the `docker stack` commands, allowing users to deploy their Docker
			# Compose projects as a Swarm service.
			"dnephin",

			# Doug Davis contributed many features and fixes for the classic builder,
			# such as "wildcard" copy, the dockerignore file, custom paths/names
			# for the Dockerfile, as well as enhancements to the API and documentation.
			# Follow Doug on Twitter, where they tweets as @duginabox.
			"duglin",

			# As a maintainer, Erik was responsible for the "builder", and
			# started the first designs for the new networking model in
			# Docker. Erik is now working on all kinds of plugins for Docker
			# (https://github.com/contiv) and various open source projects
			# in his own repository https://github.com/erikh. You may
			# still stumble into them in our issue tracker, or on IRC.
			"erikh",

			# Evan Hazlett is the creator of the Shipyard and Interlock open source projects,
			# and the author of "Orca", which became the foundation of Docker Universal Control
			# Plane (UCP). As a maintainer, Evan helped integrating SwarmKit (secrets, tasks)
			# into the Docker engine.
			"ehazlett",

			# Arnaud Porterie (AKA "icecrime") was in charge of maintaining the maintainers.
			# As a maintainer, they made life easier for contributors to the Docker open-source
			# projects, bringing order in the chaos by designing a triage- and review workflow
			# using labels (see https://icecrime.net/technology/a-structured-approach-to-labeling/),
			# and automating the hell out of things with their buddies GordonTheTurtle and Poule
			# (a chicken!).
			# 
			# A lesser-known fact is that they created the first commit in the libnetwork repository
			# even though they didn't know anything about it. Some say, they's now selling stuff on
			# the internet ;-)
			"icecrime",

			# After a false start with their first PR being rejected, James Turnbull became a frequent
			# contributor to the documentation, and became a docs maintainer on December 5, 2013. As
			# a maintainer, James lifted the docs to a higher standard, and introduced the community
			# guidelines ("three strikes"). James is currently changing the world as CTO of https://www.empatico.org,
			# meanwhile authoring various books that are worth checking out. You can find them on Twitter,
			# rambling as @kartar, and although no longer active as a maintainer, they's always "game" to
			# help out reviewing docs PRs, so you may still see them around in the repository.
			"jamtur01",

			# Jessica Frazelle, also known as the "Keyser Söze of containers",
			# runs *everything* in containers. They started contributing to
			# Docker with a (fun fun) change involving both iptables and regular
			# expressions (coz, YOLO!) on July 10, 2014
			# https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/6950/commits/f3a68ffa390fb851115c77783fa4031f1d3b2995.
			# Jess was Release Captain for Docker 1.4, 1.6 and 1.7, and contributed
			# many features and improvement, among which "seccomp profiles" (making
			# containers a lot more secure). Besides being a maintainer, they
			# set up the CI infrastructure for the project, giving everyone
			# something to shout at if a PR failed ("noooo Janky!").
			# Be sure you don't miss them talks at a conference near you (a must-see),
			# read her blog at https://blog.jessfraz.com (a must-read), and
			# check out her open source projects on GitHub https://github.com/jessfraz (a must-try).
			"jessfraz",

			# As a maintainer, John Howard managed to make the impossible possible;
			# to run Docker on Windows. After facing many challenges, teaching
			# fellow-maintainers that 'Windows is not Linux', and many changes in
			# Windows Server to facilitate containers, native Windows containers
			# saw the light of day in 2015.
			#
			# John is now enjoying life without containers: playing piano, painting,
			# and walking their dogs, but you may occasionally see them drop by on GitHub.
			"lowenna",

			# Alexander Morozov contributed many features to Docker, worked on the premise of 
			# what later became containerd (and worked on that too), and made a "stupid" Go
			# vendor tool specifically for docker/docker needs: vndr (https://github.com/LK4D4/vndr).
			# Not many know that Alexander is a master negotiator, being able to change course
			# of action with a single "Nope, we're not gonna do that".
			"lk4d4",

			# Madhu Venugopal was part of the SocketPlane team that joined Docker.
			# As a maintainer, they was working with Jana for the Container Network
			# Model (CNM) implemented through libnetwork, and the "routing mesh" powering
			# Swarm mode networking.
			"mavenugo",

			# As a maintainer, Kenfe-Mickaël Laventure worked on the container runtime,
			# integrating containerd 1.0 with the daemon, and adding support for custom
			# OCI runtimes, as well as implementing the `docker prune` subcommands,
			# which was a welcome feature to be added. You can keep up with Mickaél on
			# Twitter (@kmlaventure).
			"mlaventure",

			# As a docs maintainer, Mary Anthony contributed greatly to the Docker
			# docs. They wrote the Docker Contributor Guide and Getting Started
			# Guides. They helped create a doc build system independent of
			# docker/docker project, and implemented a new docs.docker.com theme and
			# nav for 2015 Dockercon. Fun fact: the most inherited layer in DockerHub
			# public repositories was originally referenced in
			# maryatdocker/docker-whale back in May 2015.
			"moxiegirl",

			# Jana Radhakrishnan was part of the SocketPlane team that joined Docker.
			# As a maintainer, they was the lead architect for the Container Network
			# Model (CNM) implemented through libnetwork, and the "routing mesh" powering
			# Swarm mode networking.
			#
			# Jana started new adventures in networking, but you can find them tweeting as @mrjana,
			# coding on GitHub https://github.com/mrjana, and he may be hiding on the Docker Community
			# slack channel :-)
			"mrjana",

			# Sven Dowideit became a well known person in the Docker ecosphere, building
			# boot2docker, and became a regular contributor to the project, starting as
			# early as October 2013 (https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/2119), to become
			# a maintainer less than two months later (https://github.com/docker/docker/pull/3061).
			#
			# As a maintainer, Sven took on the task to convert the documentation from
			# ReStructuredText to Markdown, migrate to Hugo for generating the docs, and
			# writing tooling for building, testing, and publishing them.
			#
			# If you're not in the occasion to visit "the Australian office", you
			# can keep up with Sven on Twitter (@SvenDowideit), his blog http://fosiki.com,
			# and of course on GitHub.
			"sven",

			# Vincent "vbatts!" Batts made their first contribution to the project
			# in November 2013, to become a maintainer a few months later, on
			# May 10, 2014 (https://github.com/docker/docker/commit/d6e666a87a01a5634c250358a94c814bf26cb778).
			# As a maintainer, Vincent made important contributions to core elements
			# of Docker, such as "distribution" (tarsum) and graphdrivers (btrfs, devicemapper).
			# They also contributed the "tar-split" library, an important element
			# for the content-addressable store.
			# Vincent is currently a member of the Open Containers Initiative
			# Technical Oversight Board (TOB), besides their work at Red Hat and
			# Project Atomic. You can still find them regularly hanging out in
			# our repository and the #docker-dev and #docker-maintainers IRC channels
			# for a chat, as they's always a lot of fun.
			"vbatts",

			# Vishnu became a maintainer to help out on the daemon codebase and
			# libcontainer integration. They's currently involved in the
			# Open Containers Initiative, working on the specifications,
			# besides their work on cAdvisor and Kubernetes for Google.
