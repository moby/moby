	[Org."Core maintainers"]

	# The Core maintainers are the ghostbusters of the project: when there's a problem others
	# can't solve, they show up and fix it with bizarre devices and weaponry.
	# They have final say on technical implementation and coding style.
	# They are ultimately responsible for quality in all its forms: usability polish,
	# bugfixes, performance, stability, etc. When ownership  can cleanly be passed to
	# a subsystem, they are responsible for doing so and holding the
	# subsystem maintainers accountable. If ownership is unclear, they are the de facto owners.

	# For each release (including minor releases), a "release captain" is assigned from the
	# pool of core maintainers. Rotation is encouraged across all maintainers, to ensure
	# the release process is clear and up-to-date.

	# The curators help ensure that incoming issues and pull requests are properly triaged and
	# that our various contribution and reviewing processes are respected. With their knowledge of
	# the repository activity, they can also guide contributors to relevant material or
	# discussions.
	#
	# They are neither code nor docs reviewers, so they are never expected to merge. They can
	# however:
	# - close an issue or pull request when it's an exact duplicate
	# - close an issue or pull request when it's inappropriate or off-topic

			# As a maintainer, Erik was responsible for the "builder", and 
			# started the first designs for the new networking model in

			# in his own repository https://github.com/erikh. You may
			# still stumble into him in our issue tracker, or on IRC.

			# Victor is one of the earliest contributors to Docker, having worked on the
			# project when it was still "dotCloud" in April 2013. He's been responsible
			# for multiple releases (https://github.com/docker/docker/pulls?q=is%3Apr+bump+in%3Atitle+author%3Avieux),
			# and up until today (2015), our number 2 contributor. Although he's no longer
			# a maintainer for the Docker "Engine", he's still actively involved in other
			# Docker projects, and most likely can be found in the Docker Swarm repository,
			# for which he's a core maintainer.
			"vieux",

			# Vishnu became a maintainer to help out on the daemon codebase and
			# libcontainer integration. He's currently involved in the
			# Open Containers Initiative, working on the specifications,
			# besides his work on cAdvisor and Kubernetes for Google.
