//
// Owning the teardown matters, rather than leaving a deferred one to each
// caller. launchNode and the formation wait below are both fatal, and a fatal
// inside a bubble runtime.Goexit()s the bubble's root goroutine -- at which
// point a caller's defer has not been reached yet, because this function has not
// returned. The nodes already launched would still be running when the bubble
// ends, which synctest reports as a deadlock panic: it kills the whole test
// binary and buries the diagnostic those two were trying to print. Cleanups run
// on the Goexit and, in a bubble, run inside it -- synctest.Test invokes the
// property through tRunner, and rapid.SyncTest calls t.cleanup() from a defer
// within its bubble -- so the teardown can still use the fake clock.
