// TestNetworkDBAlwaysConverges drives a cluster of NetworkDB instances with a
// random sequence of joins, leaves and table writes, then asserts that every
// node's view of the table ends up identical.
//
// This test exists to explore interleavings, and deliberately never quiesces
// the cluster between actions: gossip is still in flight when the next mutation
// lands, which is where the interesting bugs are. That is also precisely why it
// cannot measure convergence latency -- by the time the property function gets
// to look, most runs have already converged during the waits the state machine
// draws, so any interval it could report would be an upper bound rather
// than a measurement. TestNetworkDBConvergenceLatency trades interleaving for
// precision and measures it properly.
//
// The whole property runs inside a [testing/synctest] bubble, gossiping over an
// in-memory network; see memcluster_test.go for why and how.
//
// # Reproducing a failure
//
// A failure prints the scenario it drew as a plan, in the form parsePlan reads
// back. Whether replaying that plan fails again is a separate question:
// convergence depends on the order gossip interleaves in, that order comes from
// goroutine scheduling, and nothing here controls scheduling. A scenario that
// failed once can pass the next hundred runs, which is what rapid reports as
// "flaky test, can not reproduce a failure".
//
// -networkdb.convergence-attempts is the lever for that, in all three modes
// below. It executes the scenario that many times -- a fresh cluster and a
// different gossip stream each time -- and fails if any execution does, turning
// a failure that shows up one run in thirty into one that shows up in nearly
// every run.
//
// Quickest is to save the printed plan to a file and replay it on its own, with
// no draw buffer, seed or failfile in the way. A plan can also be trimmed by
// hand, which is often faster than asking rapid to minimize it:
//
//	go test ./daemon/libnetwork/networkdb/ -run TestNetworkDBReplayScenario \
//	    -networkdb.convergence-plan=/tmp/plan.txt -networkdb.convergence-attempts=250
//
// A relative path there is resolved against the package directory, since that is
// where go test runs the binary, so an absolute one saves confusion.
//
// Replaying rapid's own failfile runs the same scenario back through the
// property, which is worth doing when the plan is not the suspect:
//
//	go test ./daemon/libnetwork/networkdb/ -run TestNetworkDBAlwaysConverges \
//	    -rapid.failfile=<failfile> -networkdb.convergence-attempts=250
//
// To have rapid minimize a scenario, run its seed instead. A failfile is only
// ever replayed, never minimized, and rapid picks up any failfile under
// testdata/rapid/ whether or not -rapid.failfile names one -- so the file has to
// be moved aside for the seed to get a look in:
//
//	mv testdata/rapid/TestNetworkDBAlwaysConverges/*.fail /tmp/
//	go test ./daemon/libnetwork/networkdb/ -run TestNetworkDBAlwaysConverges \
//	    -rapid.seed=<seed> -networkdb.convergence-attempts=250 -rapid.shrinktime=10m
//
// Set attempts high enough that a failing scenario fails on nearly every batch,
// not merely most of them. rapid gets a single batch to confirm a failure before
// it starts minimizing, and judges each candidate on a single batch after that,
// reading any batch that passes as the bug being absent. The logged "attempt N of
// M" is the guide: at attempt 29 of 50, one execution finds that scenario about
// 3% of the time, so 50 attempts leaves roughly a one-in-five chance that the
// confirmation batch passes and the failure is written off as flaky. Minimizing
// is also the expensive mode, because rapid spends the whole attempt budget on
// every scenario that passes.
//
// Searching wants the opposite of repetition -- for a fixed execution budget,
// distinct scenarios find more bugs than repeats of one -- so the default is 1.
//
// Once a scenario is minimized and understood, commit it under
// testdata/scenarios so it keeps being run; see TestNetworkDBScenarios. The
// search is not guaranteed to draw it again.
