// Convergence latency measurement.
//
// This is the counterpart to TestNetworkDBAlwaysConverges. That test explores
// interleavings and makes no timing claims; this one gives up interleaving
// entirely in exchange for a clean measurement:
//
//   - The cluster is quiesced before the clock starts, so nothing is in flight
//     that the measurement did not cause.
//   - Exactly one perturbation is applied, of a known kind, so every sample is
//     attributable rather than being the aggregate of a random action mix.
//   - The target is a Lamport time, not a value. A write at ltime L has reached
//     a node once that node holds the key at ltime >= L. That is immune to a
//     later write superseding the value, and unlike value equality it stays
//     well defined if anything else is in flight.
//   - Convergence is watched from the last mutation onwards rather than after
//     the fact, so no sample is left-censored.
//
// The measurements are virtual time from inside a [testing/synctest] bubble.
// They isolate the algorithm from machine load and are comparable across runs
// and machines, but they account for none of the network RTT, syscall or
// serialization cost a real cluster pays. They are a floor for any wall-clock
// figure, never the figure itself.
//
// A corollary worth keeping in mind when reading a zero: virtual time only
// advances on a timer, so work which completes without waiting for one costs
// nothing here however much real work it does. A synchronous bulk sync over the
// in-memory network is instantaneous in virtual time and would not be on a real
// one. What a zero means is "no timer had to fire", which is a genuine and
// useful property -- it is the difference between propagating on the next gossip
// tick and propagating right now -- but it is not "no time passed".
