// Package jobsv0 defines the extension point through which the jobs extension
// exposes its client-facing API on the daemon socket.
//
// A Job is a daemon-managed resource holding a container spec plus a trigger
// declaration; each execution is a Run with a stable identity that survives
// container removal. Jobs fire manually or on a cron schedule; the daemon
// evaluates schedule triggers on its own clock, so scheduled work keeps firing
// while no client is connected.
//
// Wire-format conventions, constrained by the mobyextgen generator (unary
// methods only; no enums, oneof, or well-known types):
//   - enumerations are documented strings (see the *State and policy constants);
//   - timestamps are int64 Unix nanoseconds, zero meaning "not set";
//   - the container definition travels as a JSON payload (see JobSpec.ContainerSpec);
//   - trigger kinds are mutually exclusive fields on a single message, and a
//     trigger declaring no known kind is rejected rather than interpreted
//     (see Trigger).
