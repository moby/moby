	// ID is the content-addressable ID of an image.
	//
	// This identifier is a content-addressable digest calculated from the
	// image's configuration (which includes the digests of layers used by
	// the image).
	//
	// Note that this digest differs from the `RepoDigests` below, which

	// image.
	//
	// Multiple image tags can refer to the same image, and this list may be

	// Required: true
	SharedSize int64 `json:"SharedSize"`
